These lectures were targeted to undergraduate and graduate students of Physics. However, it is increasingly apparent that interest in Relativity extends beyond these academic circles. Because of this reason, this book intends to become useful to students of related disciplines and to other readers interested in Einstein’s work, who will be able to incorporate entirely the fundamental ideas of Relativity starting from the very basic concepts of Physics. To understand the Theory of Relativity it is necessary to give up our intuitive notions of space and time, i.e., the notions used in our daily relation with the world. These classical notions of space and time are also the foundations of Newtonian mechanics, which dominated Physics for over two centuries until they clashed with Maxwell’s electromagnetism. Classical physics assumed that space is immutable and its geometry obeys the Euclidean postulates. Furthermore, distances and time intervals are believed invariant, i.e., independent of the state of motion. Both preconceptions about the nature of space and time rely firmly on our daily experience, in such a way that the classical notions are imprinted in our thought with the status of “true.” Therefore, we tend to resist abandoning the classical notions of space and time, and to replace them with other notions that are not evident in the phenomena observed in our daily life. This state of affairs can take the student of Relativity to a mode of thinking vitiated by the coexistence of old and new conceptions of space and time, which would lead to several perplexities and paradoxes. The historical approach of this text attempts to guide the reader along the same road followed by Physics between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries, thus reproducing the intellectual process that led to the relativistic way of conceiving the space-time. After this journey, the reader will become more receptive to the consequences of the change of paradigm. Chapters 1–7 contain a complete course on Special Relativity that can be adapted to an introductory level by means of a suitable choice of issues. In this sense, the text is conceived to allow its reading in several levels, since some subjects that could hinder the reading by beginners have been located as Complements inside boxes. The historical road toward Special Relativity is v

Foreword THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK DIFFERS by only two letters from that of a book first published in 1988. A Brief History of Time was on the London SundayTimes best-seller list for 237 weeks and has sold about one copy for every 750 men, women, and children on earth. It was a remarkable success for a book that addressed some of the most difficult issues in modern physics. Yet those difficult issues are also the most exciting, for they address big, basicquestions: What do we really know about the universe? How do we know it? Where did the universe come from, and where is it going? Those questions were the essence of A Brief History of Time, and they are also the focus of this book. In the years since A Brief History of Time was published, feedback has come in from readers of all ages, of all professions, and from all over theworld. One repeated request has been for a new version, one that maintains the essence of A Brief History yet explains the most important concepts in a clearer, more leisurely manner. Although one might expect that such a book would be entitled A Less Brief History of Time, it was also clear from thefeedback that few readers are seeking a lengthy dissertation befitting a college-level course in cosmology. Thus, the present approach. In writing A Briefer History of Time we have maintained and expanded the essential content of the original book, yet taken care to maintain its length and readability.This is a briefer history indeed, for some of the more technical content has been left out, but we feel we have more than compensated for that by the more probing treatment of the material that is really the heart of the book. We have also taken the opportunity to update the book and include new theoretical and observational results. A Briefer History of Time describesrecent progress that has been made in finding a complete unified theory of all the forces of physics. In particular, it describes the progress made in string theory, and the "dualities" or correspondences between apparently different theories of physics that are an indication that there is a unified theory ofphysics. On the observational side, the book includes important new observations such as those made by the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE) and by the Hubble Space Telescope. Some forty years ago Richard Feynman said, "We are lucky to live in an age in which we are still making discoveries. It is like the discovery of America—y ou only discover it once. The age in which we live is the age in which we are discovering the fundamental laws of nature." Today, we are closer than ever before to understanding the nature of the universe. Our goal in writing this book is to share some of the excitement of these discoveries, and the newpicture of reality that is emerging as a result. 
Fisica A Companion to Classical Electrodynamics 3rd Edition by J.D. Jackson Rudolph J. Magyar August 6, 2001 c©Rudolph J. Magyar. No portion of this may be reproduced for profit without the expressed prior written consent of Rudolph J. Magyar. 1 A lot of things can be said about Classical Electrodynamics, the third edition, by David J. Jackson. It’s seemingly exhaustive, well researched, and certainly popular. Then, there is a general consensus among teachers that this book is the definitive graduate text on the subject. In my opinion, this is quite unfortunate. The text often assumes familiarity with the material, skips vital steps, and provides too few examples. It is simply not a good introductory text. On the other hand, Jackson was very ambitious. Aside from some notable omissions (such as conformal mapping methods), Jackson exposes the reader to most of classical electro-magnetic theory. Even Thomas Aquinas would be impressed! As a reference, Jackson’s book is great! It is obvious that Jackson knows his stuff, and in no place is this more apparent than in the problems which he asks at the end of each chapter. Sometimes the problems are quite simple or routine, other times difficult, and quite often there will be undaunting amounts of algebra required. Solving these problems is a time consuming endevour for even the quickest reckoners among us. I present this Companion to Jackson as a motivation to other students. These problems can be done! And it doesn’t take Feynmann to do them. Hopefully, with the help of this guide, lots of paper, and your own wits; you’ll be able to wrestle with the concepts that challenged the greatest minds of the last century. Before I begin, I will recommend several things which I found useful in solving these problems. • Buy Griffiths’ text, an Introduction to Electrodynamics. It’s well writ- ten and introduces the basic concepts well. This text is at a more basic level than Jackson, and to be best prepared, you’ll have to find other texts at Jackson’s level. But remember Rome wasn’t build in a day, and you have to start somewhere. • Obtain other texts on the level (or near to it) of Jackson. I rec- ommend Vanderlinde’s Electromagnetism book or Eyges’ Electromag- netism book. Both provide helpful insights into what Jackson is talking about. But even more usefully, different authors like to borrow each others’ problems and examples. A problem in Jackson’s text might be an example in one of these other texts. Or the problem might be rephrased in the other text; the rephrased versions often provide insight into what Jackson’s asking! After all half the skill in writing a hard i physics problem is wording the problem vaguely enough so that no one can figure out what your talking about. • First try to solve the problem without even reading the text. More often than not, you can solve the problem with just algebra or only a superficial knowledge of the topic. It’s unfortunate, but a great deal of physics problems tend to be just turning the crank. Do remember to go back and actually read the text though. Solving physics problems is meaningless if you don’t try to understand the basic science about what is going on. • If you are allowed, compare your results and methods with other stu- dents. This is helpful. People are quick to tear apart weak arguments andthereby help you strengthen your own understanding ofthe physics. Also, if you are like me, you are a king of stupid algebraic mistakes. If ten people have one result, and you have another, there’s a good like- lihood that you made an algebraic mistake. Find it. If it’s not there, try to find what the other people could have done wrong. Maybe, you are both correct! • Check journal citations. When Jackson cites a journal, find the refer- ence, and read it. Sometimes, the problem is solved in the reference, but always, the references provide vital insight into the science behind the equations. A note about units, notation, and diction is in order. I prefer SI units and will use these units whenever possible. However, in some cases, the use of Jacksonian units is inevitable, and I will switch without warning, but of course, I plan to maintain consistency within any particular problem. I will set c = 1 and ¯h = 1 when it makes life easier; hopefully, I will inform the reader when this happens. I have tried, but failed, to be regular with my symbols. In each case, the meaning of various letters should be obvious, or else if I remember, I will define new symbols. I try to avoid the clumsy d3vectorx symbols for volume elements and the d2vectorx symbols for area elements; instead, I use dV and dA. Also, I will use ˆx,ˆy, and ˆz instead of ˆi,ˆj, and ˆk. The only times I will use ijk’s will be for indices. Please, feel free to contact me, rmagyar@eden.rutgers.edu, about any typos or egregious errors. I’m sure there are quite a few. ii Now, the fun begins... iii Problem 1.1 Use Gauss’ theorem to prove the following: a. Any excess charge placed on a conductor must lie entirely on its surface. In Jackson’s own words, “A conductor by definition contains charges capable of moving freely under the action of applied electric fields”. That implies that in the presence of electric fields, the charges in the conductor will be accelerated. In a steady configuration, we should expect the charges not to accelerate. For the charges to be non-accelerating, the electric field must vanish everywhere inside the conductor, vectorE = 0. When vectorE = 0 everywhere inside the conductor 1, the divergence of vectorE must vanish. By Gauss’s law, we see that this also implies that the charge density inside the conductor vanishes: 0 = ?· vectorE = ??0. b. A closed, hollow conductor shields its interior from fields due to charges outside, but does not shield its exterior from the fields due to charges placed inside it. The charge density within the conductor is zero, but the charges must be located somewhere! The only other place in on the surfaces. We use Gauss’s law in its integral form to find the field outside the conductor. integraldisplay vectorE·dvectorA = 1 ?0 summationdisplayq i Where the sum is over all enclosed charges. Evidently, the field outside the conductor depends on the surface charges and also those charges concealed deep within the cavities of the conductor. c. The electric field at the surface of a conductor is normal to the surface and has a magnitude ??0, where ? is the charge density per unit area on the surface. We assume that the surface charge is static. Then, vectorE at the surface of a con- ductor must be normal to the surface; otherwise, the tangential components of the E-field would cause charges to flow on the surface, and that would contradict the static condition we already assumed. Consider a small area. integraldisplay ?· vectorEdV = integraldisplay vectorE·dvectorA = integraldisplay ? ?0dV 1excluding of course charge contained within any cavities 1

Fall, 2000 Copyright © 2000 by Dennis C. Prieve Algebra of Vectors and Tensors Whereas heat and mass are scalars, fluid mechanics concerns transport of momentum, which is a vector.  Heat and mass fluxes are vectors, momentum flux is a tensor.  Consequently, the mathematical description of fluid flow tends to be more abstract and subtle than for heat and mass transfer.  In an effort to make the student more comfortable with the mathematics, we will start with a review of the algebra of vectors and an introduction to tensors and dyads.  A brief review of vector addition and multiplication can be found in Greenberg,? pages 132-139. Scalar - a quantity having magnitude but no direction (e.g. temperature, density) Vector - (a.k.a. 1st rank tensor) a quantity having magnitude and direction (e.g. velocity, force, momentum) (2nd rank) Tensor - a quantity having magnitude and two directions (e.g. momentum flux, stress) VECTOR MULTIPLICATION Given two arbitrary vectors a and b, there are three types of vector products are defined: Notation Result Definition Dot Product a.b scalar ab cos?

The “right-hand rule”: with the fingers of the right hand initially pointing in the direction of the first vector, rotate the fingers to point in the direction of the second vector; the thumb then points in the direction with the correct sense.  Of course, the thumb should have been normal to the plane containing both vectors during the rotation.

Banks Department of Physics and Institute for Particle Physics University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 and Department of Physics and Astronomy, NHETC Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08540 E-mail: banks@scipp.ucsc.edu ABSTRACT I present a point of view about what M Theory is and how it is related to the real world that departs in certain crucial respects from conventional wisdom. I argue against the possibility of a background independent formulation of the theory, or of a Poincare in- variant, Supersymmetry violating vacuum state. A fundamental assumption is black hole dominance of high energy physics.Much of this paper is a compilation of things I have said elsewhere. I review a crude argument for the critical exponent connecting the gravitino mass and the cosmological constant, and propose a framework for the finding a quantum theory of de Sitter space. 1 1. Introduction: The Conventional Wisdom String theory, although it is a theory of gravity, is a creation of particle physicists. Traditional string phenomenology shows its pedigree by asking for an exact solution of a purported theory of everything, which exhibits exact Poincare symmetry (a symmetry which is clearly only approximate in the real world). This theory is supposed to describe the scattering of particles in the real world, which is thus postulated to be insensitive to the cosmological nature of the universe. The basis for this assumption is locality, a property that is evidently only approxi- mately true of string theory at low energy. Super Planckian scattering is dominated by black hole production[1] , and the spectrum and properties of black holes of sufficiently high energy are definitely affected by the global structure of the universe. By continuity, there are effects on low energy physics as well. The only question is how large they are. At any rate, a principal defect of this approach is that it already postulates two math- ematically consistent solutions of the theory of everything, namely the real, cosmological, world, and the exact Poincare invariant solution. In fact, as is well known, the situation is much worse than that. There are many disconnected continuous families of Poincare invariant solutions of string theory. They have various dimensions, low energy fields, and topologies, but they all share the property of exact SUSY. The program of string phe- nomenology is to find a SUSY violating, Poincare invariant solution of the theory, which describes low energy scattering in the real world. In [2] I expressed the opinion that no such solution exists. Be that as it may, the string phenomenologist, having found the holy grail of a Poincare invariant, SUSY violating, ”realistic” theory, will still be faced with the question of why it is preferred over all of the vacuum states with exact supersymmetry. By contrast, if one adopts the hypothesis of cosmological SUSY breaking (CSB) pro- posed in [2] , this problem is solved at a stroke. The theory of the real world has a finite number of states1 and can be neither Poincare invariant, nor supersymmetric. Since the number of states in the real world is e10120, it would not be surprising to find that some of the properties of the real world are well approximated by those of a Poincare invariant 1 The suggestion that the dS entropy represented a bound on the number of states in dS space first arose in conversations initiated by W. Fischler. I asked Fischler to be a coauthor on [2], but he declined on the grounds that he had not contributed to the ideas about SUSY breaking. Fischler talked about the finite number of states at the Festschrift for G. West in the Spring of 2000[3]. 2 theory, which I will call the limiting vacuum. By the arguments (reviewed below) of [2] , this limiting theory must be SUSic and have no moduli. The combination of these two properties and the general structure of SUSic theories imply that it must be four dimen- sional, with onlyN = 1 SUSY, and have an exact complex R symmetry2. This puts strong constraints on the low energy effective theory in the limiting vacuum. I have described approaches to the low energy phenomenology of CSB in a recent paper[4]. In this paper I want to summarize a collection of ideas that I have been playing with since 1999. They form a context in which the hypothesis of CSB is seen as a natural extension of the facts we already know about M-theory. These ideas are only loosely connected and have not yet jelled into a consistent alternative to the conventional wisdom about the way in which string theory is connected tothe real world. Iam setting them down here in the hope that others can make more progress thinking about them than I have. If these ideas are even partially correct, then they imply that some of our fundamental assumptions have been wrong, and I think it is important that we revise them. The key concepts revolve around the search for the fundamental degrees of freedom of a quantum theory of gravity, and the conviction that these are intimately connected with the high energy behavior of the theory. All of our experience with quantum theories suggests this connection. This is nowhere more evident than in Feynman’s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. The key step in the derivation of the path integral is the exact evaluation of the short time propagation kernel, and the key assumption is that the short time behavior is dominated by a free theory. In this view, all of the formalism of classical mechanics and canonical quantization is a consequence of the assumption of what we have learned to call a Gaussian fixed point. For this reason, I will call theories whose short time behavior is dominated by a Gaussian fixed point, Lagrangian theories. Wilson’s view of general quantum field theory as constructed from relevant perturba- tions of general fixed point theories, may be thought of as an extension of Feynman’s princi- ple. Again, the high energy behavior defines the theory. It has been our fortune/misfortune to, for the most part, be able to access non-Gaussian fixed point theories as infrared (IR) limits of Lagrangian theories. Another avenue to non-Gaussian fixed point theories has been through cutoff models, mostly arising from statistical mechanics. The resemblance of the statistical sums in these models to discretized path integrals has helped to obscure the non-Lagrangian nature of the fixed points. It is only with the discovery of fixed points 2 One must also use the fact that the theory has a dS deformation to prove this. 3 like the (2,0) theory in six dimensions, which have not yet been realized as infrared limits of Gaussian models (this is impossible) or discretized statistical sums (this is possible but unknown at the moment) that we have been forced to face the truly radical departure from Lagrangian dynamics that a non-Gaussian fixed point implies. It is my opinion, that in attempting to construct a theory of quantum gravity we should again look to the high energy behavior of the theory. When we do so, we are faced with several shocks. Firstly, the traditional connection between high energy and short distance disappears. Even in perturbative string theory, high energy physics is dominated by long strings. More generally, in any theory containing gravity there will be black holes. The Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the entropy of black holes suggests that they dominate the high energy spectrum[5], and semiclassical black hole dynamics suggests that they are metastable. Recent verifications [6] that the Bekenstein-Hawking formula indeed refers to a microscopic count of all of the states of a black hole, lend credence to this point of view. Arguments to be reviewed below suggest that high energy scattering processes are dominated by black hole production. The result of these considerations is a radical new principle, which I consider to be the ultimate form of the UV/IR correspondence : High Energy Dynamics is dominated by large black holes, some of whose properties can be calculated using the semiclassical Lagrangian formulation of general relativity. At the Davidfest in Santa Barbara, I called this principle Asymptotic Darkness. The fact that certain features of black holes are describable in the IR limiting theory is a direct consequence of the UV/IR connection. The GR description of black holes is however incomplete. It can give partial evidence for a huge set of states associated with the black hole but cannot give a microscopic quantum description of their properties. The assumption that black holes dominate the high energy physics of quantum grav- ity, and thus should be taken as a clue to the whereabouts of the fundamental degrees of freedom, has several dramatic consequences. First of all, it immediately suggests the Holo- graphic Principle [7] : degrees of freedom should be associated with (d?2) dimensional areas in spacetime, rather than with points. At very high energy densities, space is filled with black holes and the area scaling of entropy becomes manifest. Fischler, Susskind and Bousso [8] have shown how to formulate this principle for a general spacetime. In space- times with appropriate3 asymptotic boundaries one can see that this suggests a formulation 3 I will explain below why I think this idea does not generalize to the spacelike boundaries of asymptotically de Sitter (dS) spaces. 4 in terms of degrees of freedom on the boundary. This fits in with arguments from string theory and quantum gravity, that the only observables in a theory of quantum gravity in asymptotically flat or AdS spacetimes are boundary correlators like the S-matrix. The AdS/CFT [9] correspondence is the most complete and successful realization of this idea. I want to emphasize that one can view the above line of reasoning as a way of guessing or deriving the AdS/CFT correspondence. Namely, the spectrum of black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes is that of a conformal field theory living on the boundary. Asymptotic Darkness, and the associated Holographic Principle then suggest that the dynamics of the spacetime is completely captured by such a conformal field theory (or a relevant perturbation of it). We now know that this is true in many cases. For asymptotically flat spacetimes the consequences of the UV/IR connection are more dramatic. Black hole dominance implies that quantum correlation functions of op- erators that do not distinguish the degenerate microstates of black holes are not tempered distributions in time, nor even the more singular distributions of quasilocal field theories [5] [10]. This means there is no way to localize the theory in time. Curiously, the black hole spectrum is consistent with locality (quasilocality for four asymptotically flat dimen- sions) in light cone time, which might suggest a reason for the ubiquitous presence of the light cone frame in Hamiltonian formulations of quantum gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime. A holographic formulation of nonperturbative quantum gravity in certain asymptot- ically flat spacetimes is provided by Matrix Theory [11]. At present it is formulated only in the approximation of discrete Light Cone Quantization (DLCQ). It is tempting to try to formulate a theory of asymptotically flat quantum gravity in more covariant terms, as a theory on null infinity. Existing descriptions of massless particles at null infinity suggest that one should not think of this as a dynamical theory. All the coordinates of null infinity are spatial (in the sense that longitudinal and transverse coordinates are treated as spatial coordinates in light cone frame). Instead, dynamics is encoded in the fact that null infinity is not a manifold , and splits naturally into two disjoint cones with a common boundary at spatial infinity. Nontrivial correlation functions in the theory are those which contain points on both components, and are nothing but the matrix elements of the S-matrix. The question that arises (a question to which there is as yet no answer) is what the dynamical principle is that determines the S-matrix. I will not discuss null infinity much in this paper. 5

Gramegna, and C. Noveroy Istituto Elettrotecnico Nazionale Galileo Ferraris, Strada delle Cacce 91, 10135 Torino, Italy (Dated: June 28, 2002) Abstract Quantum Mechanics is a pillar of modern physics, con rmed by a huge amount of experiments. Nevertheless, it presents many unintuitive properties, strongly di ering from classical mechanics due to its intrinsic non-epistemic probabilistic nature. Many attempts have been devoted to build a deterministic theory reproducing all the results of Standard Quantum Mechanics (SQM), but where probabilities are epistemic, namely due to our ignorance of some hidden variables. These theories can be local or non-local. The formers are substantially excluded by Bell inequalities experiments [1, 3]. The latter include the de Broglie - Bohm (dBB) one [1, 8], the most successful attempt in this sense. DBB theory is built in order to reproduce almost all SQM predictions. However, it has recently been shown [4, 5, 6] that di erent coincidence patterns are predicted by SQM and dBB when a double slit experiment is realised under speci c conditions, in particular no coincidence is expected when the two photodetectors are in the same semiplane respect to the median symmetry axis of the double slit. In this letter we present the  rst realisation of such a double slit experiment with correlated photons produced in type I parametric down conversion. We observe a perfect agreement with SQM prediction and a coincidence peak almost 8 standard deviations above zero, when the two photodetectors are well inside the same semiplane: Thus our results con rm Standard Quantum Mechanics contradicting dBB predictions.

INTRODUCTION Quantum Mechanics represents a pillar of modern physics: an impressive amount of experiments have con rmed this theory and many technological applications are based on it. According to its standard interpretation, Quantum Mechanics nature is intrinsically prob- abilistic, permitting only predictions about probabilities of the occurrence of an event [1]. The state of a system is described by a wave function, whose modulus squared gives the probability density distribution of the system. Of course, in this picture, physical systems do not follow trajectories in their motion because of their position is not perfectly de ned. The non-epistemic nature of probabilities in SQM leads to many unintuitive properties of quan- tum systems and, more badly than that, the transition between the microscopic quantum world and macroscopic deterministic classical world remains unsolved: None of the many attempts to give a solution of macro- objectivation [1] has e ectively reached a universal consent in physicists community. Starting from an Einstein’s [2] work, many attempts have been devoted to build a deter- ministic theory reproducing all the results of SQM, in which probabilities become epistemic, namely are due to our ignorance of some hidden variables, whose knowledge would in fact make the evolution of the system perfectly determined. A fundamental paper of Bell [9] showed that local Hidden Variable Theories (HVT) cannot reproduce all the results of SQM. Since then a lot of experiments have been addressed to test local HVT against SQM. All of them [1, 3] con rmed SQM, even though a conclusive experiment is still missing due to the low detection e ciency, which leads to the need of an additional hypothesis stating that the  nal measured sample is a faithful representation of the initial one (detection loophole) [10]. However, Bell theorem does not apply to non-local hidden variable theories, including the de Broglie-Bohm one [1, 7, 8], the most serious and successful attempt to propose an alternative to SQM. In this theory the hidden variable is the position of the particle, which follows a perfectly de ned trajectory in its motion. The evolution of the system is given by classical equations of motion, but an additional potential must be included. This "quantum" potential is related to the wave function of the system and thus it is non-local. The inclusion of this term, together with an initial distribution of particles positions given 2 by the quantum probability density, successfully allows the reproduction of almost all the predictions of quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, in a series of recent papers [4, 5, 6] it has been shown that under particular conditions (namely when the system is not ergodic [15]) di erent experimental results are predicted by dBB and SQM, allowing a test of the two theories. In particular, in dBB one expects that [4, 5, 6], due to the non-crossing theorem, in a double slit experiment, where two identical particles cross simultaneously each a precise slit, no coincidence can be measured in the same semiplane respect to the median symmetry axis of the two slits. II. DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENT In order to test this prediction we have realised a novel experimental con guration in which two identical photons reach a double slit at the same time, each one crossing a di erent slit, according to the con guration proposed in ref. [4, 5, 6]. However, it must be pointed out that only in some versions of dBB theory the photon is described as a particle [4, 5, 7, 8, 11]: therefore our test concerns these versions of the theory, which have the fundamental advantage of describing bosons and fermions on the same ground. If the experiment will be repeated with fermions a conclusive test of dBB will be obtained. In the last years some experiments [12, 13, 14] were performed, in which PDC light was crossing a double slit, but in none of them a median symmetry axis was well de ned and a con guration suitable for the present test was realized. More in details (see  g.1) a 351 nm pump laser of 0.4 W power is directed into a lithium iodate crystal, where correlated pairs of photons are generated by type I parametric down conversion (PDC) [3]. The two photons are emitted at the same time (within femtoseconds, whilst correlation time is some orders of magnitude larger) on a well de ned direction for a speci c frequency. By means of an optical condenser the produced photons, within two correlated directions corresponding both to 702 nm emission (the degenerate emission for a 351 nm pump laser), are sent on a double slit (obtained by a metal deposition on a thin glass by a photolithographic process) placed just before the focus of the lens system. The two slits are separated by 100  m and have a width of 10  m. They lay in a plane orthogonal to the incident laser beam and are orthogonal to the table plane. Two EG&G single photon detectors are placed at a 1.21 and a 1.5 m distance after the slits. They are preceded by 3 an interferential  lter at 702 nm of 4 nm full width at half height and by a lens of 6 mm diameter and 25.4 mm focal length. The output signals from the detectors are routed to a two channel counter, in order to have the number of events on a single channel, and to a Time to Amplitude Converter (TAC) circuit, followed by a single channel analyser, for selecting and counting the coincidence events. With this experimental set-up, we obtained that a clear signal appeared on the multi- channel analyser when the detectors were placed in the positions where the maximum of coincidences was expected, namely at 2 degrees, in two di erent semiplanes, respect to the median symmetry axis of the double slit (which is parallel to the incident pump laser). In order to check that the two degenerate photons crossed two di erent slits, we have alterna- tively closed one of the slits leaving the other opened: correspondingly, the coincidence peak disappeared and the signal on the related detector dropped to background level, con rm- ing the correct position of the double slit. Then we moved the  rst detector scanning the di raction pattern, leaving the second  xed at 5.5 cm from the symmetry axis. We found that the coincidences pattern perfectly followed quantum mechanics predictions, see  g.2. The last ones are given by: C( 1; 2) = g( 1; Ai )2g( 2; Bi )2 +g( 2; Ai )2g( 1; Bi )2+ 2g( 1; Ai )g( 2; Bi )g( 2; Ai )g( 1; Bi )cos[ks(sin 1 sin 2)] (1) where g( ; li) = sin(kw=2(sin( ) sin(  l i)) kw=2(sin( ) sin( li)) (2) takes into account di raction. k is the wave vector, s the slits separation, w the slit width,  1;2 is the di raction angle of the photon observed by detector 1 or 2,  li the incidence angle of the photon on the slit l (A or B). Because of  nite width of the slit, a partial penetration of trajectories in the opposite semiplane is possible, however this penetration is of the order of the slit width [4] (10  m) and thus negligible. The fundamental result of our experiment is that a coincidence peak is clearly observed (see  g.3) also when the  rst detector is placed inside enough the same semiplane of the second one. We consider coincidences acquisitions with a temporal window of 2.6 ns, the background is evaluated shifting the delay between start and stop of TAC of 16 ns and 4 acquiring data for the same time of the undelayed acquisition. When the edge of the lens of the  rst detector is placed -1.4 cm (the center -1.7 cm) after the median symmetry axis of the two slits (the minus means on the left of symmetry axis looking toward to the crystal), whilst the second detector is kept at -5.5 cm, with 35 acquisitions of 30’ each we obtained 78  10 coincidences per 30 minutes after background subtraction, whilst in this situation the dBB [4, 5, 6] prediction for coincidences is strictly zero. Furthermore, even when the two detectors were placed in the same semiplane the  rst at -4.44 and the second at -11.7 cm from the symmetry axis, in correspondence of the second di raction peak, a clear coincidence signal was still observed (albeit less evident than in the former case): We obtained in fact, after background subtraction, an average of 41  14 coincidences per hour with 17 acquisitions of one hour (and a clear peak appeared on the multichannel analyser). Therefore we can conclude that our results are in perfect agreement with SQM predictions, but contradict of almost 8 standard deviations the predictions of dBB theory presented in ref. [4, 5, 6]. III. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion we have realised the  rst experimental test of de Broglie-Bohm theory against standard Quantum Mechanics following the proposal of ref. [4, 5, 6]. DBB predicts that in a double slit experiment, in which two identical particles simultaneously cross each a precise slit, their trajectories remain in the semiplane of the crossed slit and thus no coincidence can be measured when two detectors are placed on the same side respect to the median symmetry axis. This result is at variance with SQM prediction. In our experiment we have clearly observed a coincidence peak when the detectors are placed in the same semiplane, con rming SQM prediction against dBB one.

Fisica  This page intentionally left blank A MODERN APPROACH TO CRITICAL PHENOMENA The study of critical phenomena is one of the most exciting areas of mod- ern physics. This book provides a thorough but economic introduction into the principles and techniques of the theory of critical phenomena and the renormalization group, from the perspective of modern condensed matter physics. Assuming basic knowledge of quantum and statistical mechanics, the book discusses phase transitions in magnets, superfluids, superconduc- tors, and gauge field theories. Particular attention is given to modern topics such as gauge field fluctuations in superconductors, the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, duality transformations, and quantum phase transitions, all of which are at the forefront of today’s physics research. A Modern Approach to Critical Phenomena contains numerous problems of varying degrees of difficulty, with solutions. These problems provide readers with a wealth of material to test their understanding of the subject. It is ideal for graduate students and more experienced researchers in the fields of condensed matter physics, statistical physics, and many-body physics.

Introduction These lecture notes were written for the American Mathematical Society (AMS) Short Course on Quantum Computation held 17-18 January 2000 in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the AMS in Washington, DC in January 2000. The notes are intended for readers with some mathematical background but with little or no exposure to quantum mechanics. The purpose of these notes is to provide such readers with enough material in quantum mechanics and quantum computation to begin reading the vast literature on quantum computation, quantum cryptography, and quantum information theory. The paper was written in an informal style. Whenever possible, each new topic was begun with the introduction of the underlying motivating intuitions, and then followed by an explanation of the accompanying math- ematical  nery. Hopefully, once having grasped the basic intuitions, the reader will  nd that the remaining material easily follows. Since this paper is intended for a diverse audience, it was written at varying levels of di culty and sophistication, from the very elementary to the more advanced. A large number of examples have been included. An A ROSSETTA STONE FOR QUANTUM MECHANICS 5 index and table of contents are provided for those readers who prefer to \pick and choose." Hopefully, this paper will provide something of interest for everyone. Because of space limitations, these notes are, of necessity, far from a complete overview of quantum mechanics. For example, only  nite dimen- sional Hilbert spaces are considered, thereby avoiding the many pathologies that always arise when dealing with in nite dimensional objects. Many important experiments that are traditionally part of the standard fare in quantum mechanics texts (such as for example, the Stern-Gerlach experi- ment, Young’s two slit experiment, the Aspect experiment) have not been mentioned in this paper. We leave it to the reader to decide if these notes have achieved their objective. The  nal version of this paper together with all the other lecture notes of the AMS Short Course on Quantum Computation will be published as a book in the AMS PSAPM Series entitled \Quantum Computation." 2. The classical world 2.1. Introducing the Shannon bit. Since one of the objectives of this paper is to discuss quantum information, we begin with a brief discussion of classical information. The Shannon bit is so well known in our age of information that it needs little, if any, introduction. As we all know, the Shannon bit is like a very decisive individual. It is either 0 or 1, but by no means both at the same time. The Shannon bit has become so much a part of our every day lives that we take many of its properties for granted. For example, we take for granted that Shannon bits can be copied. 2.2. Polarized light: Part I. The classical perspective. Throughout this paper the quantum polarization states of light will be used to provide concrete illustrations of underlying quantum mechanical principles. So we also begin with a brief discussion of polarized light from the classical perspective. Light waves in the vacuum are transverse electromagnetic (EM) waves with both electric and magnetic  eld vectors perpendicular to the direction of propagation and also to each other. (See  gure 1.) 
Fisica A semi-staggered dilation-free finite-volume method  for the numerical solution of viscoelastic fluid flows  on all-hexahedral elements Mehmet SAHIN & Helen J. WILSON Department of Mathematics, University College London Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, UK  29 April 2006 Crete/GREECE Why semi-staggered? • The semi-staggered grid arrangement has better pressure coupling compare to  the non-staggered (collocated) approach while being capable of handling non- cartesian grids. • It eliminates the need for a pressure boundary condition since it is defined at  interior points. • The summation of the continuity equation within each element can be exactly  reduced to the domain boundary, which is important for the global mass  conservation. • The most appealing feature of the method is leading to very simple algorithm  consistent with the boundary and initial conditions required by the Navier-Stokes  equations. • Recent works on semi-staggered methods: Rida et al. (1997), Kobayashi et al.  (1999), Wright and Smith (2001, 2003), etc. • First, hexahedral meshes perform quite well when local mesh is strongly  unisotropic such as boundary layers. • Second, they are more accurate and efficient for a fixed number of grid points. • In addition, when cell-centered discretization is used other elements cause the  number of unknows increase significantly for a same number of mesh points  which is case for the pressure term in our semi-staggered discretization. • All-hexahedral mesh generation for a general geometry is still difficult task  compare to other elements such as tetrahedral, pyramid, etc. However, recently  several all-hexahedral commercial grid generation programs become available  (HEXPRESS, KUBRIX, etc.) Why all-hexahedral mesh? Why dilation-free? • The problem with non-conservative approaches is that high pressure gradients  result in high values of the fourth-order pressure derivatives and thus a  significant mass source is generated (such as at high blockage ratios, etc.). • Unequal-order approximation is dilation-free but it leads to very coarse mesh for  the pressure term and it may not be very accurate. • Most of the block preconditioners for saddle point problems are designed for  dilation free methods. These preconditioners lead to more robust solution  techniques compare to SIMPLE, SIMPLER, etc. type decoupled solution  techniques.

In this paper we consider two forms of the Dirac equation. Namely Hestenes’ form of the Dirac Equation (HDE) and the Tensor form of the Dirac Equation (TDE). The aim of this paper is to prove the following theorem. Theorem 1. The Dirac equation for an electron (2) (see [9]) can be written in a form of linear tensor equation (58). An equation is said to be written in a form of tensor equation if all values in it are tensors and all operations in it take tensors to tensors. A column of four complex valued functions (a bispinor) represents the wave function of the electron in the Dirac equation. This wave function has unusual (compared to tensors) transformation properties under Lorentz changes of coordinates. These properties are investigated in the theory of spinors (see [1],[2],[3],[20],[23]). 2 There were attempts to find tensor equations equivalent to the Dirac equation [11],[12],[13]. The resulting equations were nonlinear. This fact leads to difficulties with the superposition principle, etc. The tensor equation under consideration in our paper is linear. In the first part of paper we consider the Clifford algebra Clscript(1,3) and in the second part we consider the exterior algebra of Minkowski space ?(E). Elements of ?(E) are covariant antisymmetric tensors and elements ofClscript(1,3) are not tensors. The tensor form of the Dirac equation (58) under consideration has three sources. The first source is the Ivanenko-Landau-K¨ahler equation (65) (see [21],[14]). This is a tensor equation and a wave function of the electron is represented in it by a nonhomogeneous covariant antisymmetric tensor field with 16 complex valued components (four times more than in the Dirac equation). The second source is Hestenes’ formofthe Diracequation (46)(see [6],[7]). The wave function of the electron is represented in it by a real even element of the Clifford algebra Clscripteven(1,3) and has 8 real valued components. This equation is equivalent to the Dirac equation (see the proof in [8]). HDE contains nontensor values namely elements of the Clifford algebra Clscript(1,3). Hence it is not a tensor equation. The third source is the constructions developed in [15], [16],[17], [18]. Also we want to mention an interesting approach to the construction of the 2D Dirac tensor equation suggested by D.Vassiliev [19]. 1 Part I. 1.1 The Dirac equation for an electron. Let E be Minkowski space with the metric tensor g = bardblgµ?bardbl = bardblgµ?bardbl = diag(1,?1,?1,?1), (1) xµ coordinates, and ?µ = ?/?xµ. Greek indices run over (0,1,2,3). Sum- mation convention over repeating indices is assumed. Our system of units is such that speed of light c, Plank’s constant ¯h, and the positron charge have the value 1. 3 The Dirac equation for an electron [9] has the form ?µ(?µ?+iaµ?)+im? = 0, (2) where ? = (?1?2?3?4)T is a column of four complex valued functions of x = (x0,x1,x2,x3) (? is the wave function of an electron), aµ = aµ(x) is a real valued covector of electromagnetic potential, m > 0 is a real constant (the electron mass), and ?µ are the Dirac ?-matrices ?0 = ? ?? ?? 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ?1 0 0 0 0 ?1 ? ?? ??, ?1 = ? ?? ?? 0 0 0 ?1 0 0 ?1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 ? ?? ??, (3) ?2 = ? ?? ?? 0 0 0 i 0 0 ?i 0 0 ?i 0 0 i 0 0 0 ? ?? ??, ?3 = ? ?? ?? 0 0 ?1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 ?1 0 0 ? ?? ??. The equation (2) is invariant under the gauge transformation ? ??exp(i?), aµ ?aµ ??µ?, (4) where ? = ?(x) is a smooth real valued function. The matrices (3) satisfy the relations ?µ?? +???µ = 2?µ?1, (5) where 1 is the 4×4-identity matrix and bardbl?µ?bardbl = diag(1,?1,?1,?1). Note that if 4×4-matrix T is invertible, then the matrices ´?µ = T?1?µT also satisfy (5). Let us denote ?µ1...µk = ?µ1 ...?µk, for 0 ?µ1 <···<µk ? 3. (6) Then the 16 matrices 1,?0,?1,?2,?3,?01,?02,?03,?12,?13,?23,?012,?013,?023,?123,?0123 (7) form a basis of the matrix algebra M(4,C) (C is the field of complex numbers and R is the field of real numbers). 4 Remark. We assume that the matrix bardbl?µ?bardbl is independent of g from (1). And more than this, the values gµ? and ?µ? have different mathematical meaning. Namely metric tensorgµ? is a geometrical object which is attribute of Minkowski space. But the matrix bardbl?µ?bardbl is an algebraic object which contains structure constants of an underlying algebra (as we see in a moment this algebra is the Clifford algebra). Accidentally, the matrices bardbl?µ?bardbl and bardblgµ?bardbl have the same diagonal form diag(1,?1,?1,?1). 1.2 The Clifford algebra and the spinor group. Let L be a real 16-dimensional vector space with basis elements enumerated by ordered multi-indices lscript,lscript0,lscript1,lscript2,lscript3,lscript01,lscript02,lscript03,lscript12,lscript13,lscript23,lscript012,lscript013,lscript023,lscript123,lscript0123. (8) Suppose the multiplication of elements of L is defined by the following rules: (i) L is an associative algebra (with the unity element lscript) w.r.t. this multi- plication; (ii) lscriptµlscript? +lscript?lscriptµ = 2?µ?lscript; (iii) lscriptµ1 ...lscriptµk = lscriptµ1...µk, for 0 ?µ1 <···<µk ? 3. Then this algebra L is called the (real) Clifford algebra1 and is denoted by Clscript(1,3), where the numbers 1 and 3 determine the signature of the matrix bardbl?µ?bardbl. The complex Clifford algebra is denoted by ClscriptC(1,3). Elements of Clscript(1,3) of the form U = summationdisplay µ1<···<µk uµ1...µklscriptµ1...µk (9) are said to be elements of rankk. For everyk = 0,1,2,3,4 the set of elements of rank k is a subspace Clscriptk(1,3) of Clscript(1,3) and Clscript(1,3) = Clscript0(1,3)?...?Clscript4(1,3) = Clscripteven(1,3)?Clscriptodd(1,3), 1The Clifford algebra was invented in 1878 by the English mathematician W.K.Clifford [10] 5

A straightforward through-transmission method removes the need for a commercial network analyzer, making this a versatile yet inexpensive tool for the characterization of magnetic materials. Initial results from gamma ferric oxide tape show good agreement with published data from a conventional, swept-"eld "xed-frequency FMR spectrometer and indicate the potential of this technique which also enables measurements of the magnetic anisotropy.

Introduction Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) is a widely used tool for the characterization of magnetic ma- terials. While being a sensitive and powerful tech- nique for determining, for example, anisotropy and damping information, it has three main disadvan- tages. Firstly, the conventional FMR spectrometer is essentially a single-frequency device thus pre- cluding frequency dependence experiments. It also uses a swept magnetic "eld which causes the mag- netic state of the sample to be perturbed, sometimes considerably, during the measurement. This is not ideal for the study of materials with broad linewidths, such as particulate recording media and ferromagnetic minerals with strong dipolar coup- ling. Finally, "eld modulation is often used to in- crease the sensitivity of the spectrometer, which leads to measurement of the "eld derivative of the absorption curve. The process of numerically integ- rating such spectra introduces errors and spectral features may be lost. This is particularly relevant in the case of inhomogeneous or weakly interacting materials. An ideal FMR spectrometer would, therefore, allow collection of both swept-"eld and 0304-8853/99/$-see front matter ( 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Schematic layout of the spectrometer. swept-frequency data without the need for numer- ical integration, whilst achieving the sensitivity of the conventional technique. Previous work has addressed some of these points but the problem has yet to be considered as a whole. A number of authors have presented swept-frequency studies of the FMR and zero-"eld permeability of a variety of materials [1}5]. The majority of these used a commercial vector network analyzer to determine the scattering parameters from which the permeability may be obtained. This is an e!ective technique but the requirement of a network analyzer makes it rela- tively expensive. Very little research has been done to extend the frequency range of the conventional spectrometer to allow swept-"eld spectra to be pro- duced at any frequency. Dorsey et al. [6] designed a swept-"eld FMR spectrometer capable of detect- ing FMR at discrete frequencies in the range 8}12 GHz. Similar work has also been done by Torres et al. [7]. The problem of numerical integration has been overcome by applying di!erent detection tech- niques to the conventional spectrometer, such as photoacoustic detection [8,9], which also allows depth pro"ling of the FMR response, and photo- thermal de#ection of a laser beam by the heat generated through FMR absorption of the micro- waves. This latter technique enables spatial resolu- tion of the FMR response across the surface of the sample, which can be applied to imaging applica- tions [10]. Another variant is ferromagnetic anti- resonance spectroscopy [11], a method which can be used to increase the penetration depth of the microwaves in metallic samples and, hence, provide information on the bulk, as opposed to the near-surface region. Here we present the design of an inexpensive but sensitive FMR spectrometer capable of producing both swept-frequency and swept-"eld spectra. The technique measures the absorption directly and no numerical data processing is required. 2. The spectrometer The spectrometer uses a through-transmission technique to measure the attenuation due to a slab of magnetic material placed inside a rectangular waveguide sample holder. The layout of the spec- trometer is shown in Fig. 1. The generator has an output power range of 5}50 mW. The sample holder is based on the resonant isola- tor, a microwave circuit device which allows propa- gation in one direction only. It operates on the principle that a circularly polarized wave will inter- act strongly with the biased magnetic material through which it is traveling only if the handedness of the precessing moments corresponds to that of the polarization; these are determined primarily by the static magnetic "eld strength and the wave propagation direction, respectively. In practice, the e!ective internal "elds associated with magneto- crystalline anisotropy also contribute to the strength of the interaction. In a rectangular waveguide isolator a suitably biased ferrite slab is situated at the position inside the guide where circular polarization would occur were it empty. Microwaves traveling in one-direc- tion (the reverse direction) will be highly attenuated by the resonating ferrite while waves traveling in the opposite or forward direction will be largely una!ected by its presence. However, once the ferrite is placed inside the guide the "eld patterns are distorted and there is no position of perfect circular polarization so waves traveling in both directions will be attenuated to some degree. The technique employed here utilizes the di!erence in these at- tenuations to determine the frequency and "eld dependence properties of thin "lm particulate ma- terials. There is nothing to be gained by completely "lling the waveguide with ferrite as the attenuation would become equal for both directions of pro- pagation and the technique would fail. The positioning of the ferrite slab is, therefore, a case of optimizing for maximum reverse attenuation, min- imum forward attenuation or maximum reverse- to-forward attenuation ratio. These three criteria 200 M.E. Unwin et al. / Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 205 (1999) 199}208 Fig. 3.

The magnetic and electric components of the RF "eld are perpendicular and parallel to the static "eld, respectively, and the direction of microwave propagation is along the waveguide. generally occur at di!erent positions inside the waveguide which can be calculated with prior knowledge of the sample parameters. The current spectrometer sample holder is, there- fore, a 0.3 m long section of WR90 rectangular waveguide in which the sample is positioned on a perspex slab as shown in Fig. 2, where the ellipses represent the particles inside the tape sample. The perspex slab can be moved across the waveguide, allowing measurements to be taken for any lateral sample position. The technique employed here is potentially much more sensitive than the procedure described by Lawson [2] since the waveguide is laterally loaded only in the region close to maximum traveling wave absorption. Its only possible drawback is the modi- "cation of the experimental lineshape by the use of the ratio of forward to reverse absorption, although the data can in principle be corrected to take this M.E.

In the former technique, samples "ll- ing the waveguide were employed and baseline subtraction achieved by making absorption measurements from an empty waveguide. However, the baseline is then not collected under the same conditions as the spectrum from the sample. Since the direction of propagation cannot be changed easily in this circuit, the transmitted power has been measured for both directions of the static magnetic "eld. The ratio of these measurements is proportional to the forward-to-reverse attenuation ratio. Although this method has the advantage of requiring no calibration, the spectral shape is modi- "ed slightly by the non-zero forward attenuation, the intensity of which depends on the sample posi- tion inside the guide. Also, care must be taken to ensure that the magnetic state of the sample is truly reversed under application of the reverse "eld, i.e. M(H)"!M(!H). This condition requires that appropriate "eld cycling schedules must be em- ployed for hysteretic materials. Fig. 3 shows the forward and reverse transmitted power for two sample positions of gamma ferric tape at 9.2 GHz. When the perspex slab (of thick- ness 1.5 mm in this case) is positioned next to the side wall, as in Fig. 2, there is signi"cant forward attenuation whereas when the slab is moved 5.5 mm from the sidewall (i.e. the sample is 7 mm from the wall) there is no measurable forward at- tenuation. Fig. 4 shows the forward-to-reverse at- tenuation ratios calculated from the data presented in Fig. 3. Although the intensity and shape of the spectra measured in this way are arti"cially modi- "ed this e!ect can be modeled electromagnetically following Gardiol [12]. The other measurements for this preliminary study have been taken at an arbitrary position inside the sample holder. How- ever, data can be produced at a number of di!erent 202 M.E.

Results To demonstrate the potential of the broadband FMR spectrometer, the absorption spectra for commercially available (TDK) gamma ferric oxide audio tape are presented. The tape samples, ap- proximately 1 m in length in total, were mounted in layers on a 4 mm thick perspex slab 3.5 cm long. The samples were initially cut and mounted so that the longitudinal axis of the recording tape was parallel to the external static B "eld and the RF E "eld in the waveguide, as indicated schematically in Fig. 2. This was necessary so as to align the easy axis with the applied "eld, since the acicular particles within the TDK tape are oriented pre- dominantly in plane along the length of the tape. The frequency range used in this study was 7.8}11.5 GHz and the applied external "eld was varied between zero and 0.3 T. A swept-"eld spectrum at 9.35 GHz agrees well with equivalent results obtained by Netzelmann [13] using a swept-"eld FMR spectrometer with photoacoustic detection, as shown in Fig. 5. There are only slight discrepancies between the two spectra which are attributable largely to di!erences in the gamma ferric oxide samples used as well as the measurement techniques employed. Swept-"eld spectra at a variety of frequencies between 7.8 and 11.0 GHz are shown in Fig. 6. The absorption peak moves to higher "elds with in- creasing frequency as expected from the basic FMR equations. All the measurements were taken at a single position within the sample holder so no conclusions can be drawn about the frequency dependence of the absorption intensity, since the intensity is also position dependent. However, the changing position of the maximum forward-to-re- verse attenuation ratio cannot be solely responsible M.E.

Fisica 5 - Aether, Electromagnetism and Free Energy http://ascension2000.com/ConvergenceIII/c305.htm 1 of 16 11/1/2002 10:17 AM CHAPTER FIVE: AETHER, ELECTROMAGNETISM AND FREE ENERGY 5.1  CONSCIOUSNESS As we look over the theories of aether, we find ourselves confronted with a direct spiritual fact: as was said in the Christian Bible, we live in and move through the body of God at all times. In Chapter Two we saw the clear evidence that the aether is directly connected to consciousness, through findings such as the Backster Effect, the Maharishi effect and the telekinetic experiments with Nina Kulagina and others. In Chapter Three we learned of Prof. Shnoll’s studies proving a clear causative relationship between planetary movements and atomic processes – and this was extended to consciousness as well by Cowan’s studies of the effect of planetary movements on financial market movements. With the new information that we have about the nature of atomic structure, our conventional scientific views seem to be completely inadequate. The only choice that remains for us at this time is to either resist the new information and refuse to acknowledge it, or make some difficult amendments to our most prized paradigms. And now our scientific ignorance is further exposed by the simple and yet completely new concepts of aether, gravity, inertia and centrifugal force. Without a doubt, Dr. Bruce DePalma’s “Spinning Ball Drop” experiment simply could not be possible unless an object was capable of storing and releasing aetheric / electromagnetic energy within its atomic structure, and interacting with the force of inertia and gravity as it moves through space. Space and matter are fundamentally identical; they simply represent different, interchangeable phases of one unified, vibrating energy source. With our new realizations about the connection between this same aether and the forces of gravity and inertia, we are truly beginning to see that there is no way for science to slice and dice up the universe into a set of impersonal laws. Ultimately, the force of gravity is the tendency for this Ultimate Being to seek Oneness within itself, and the force of inertia is the natural energetic resistance that we experience as we move through the body of this Ultimate Being. When all is ultimately a Unified Field of energy, and that energy is ultimately conscious, then we are all part of this vast, interconnected Oneness. Love, instead of being a vague  esoteric concept, becomes simply the tendency for the aether to vibrate in greater harmony with Unity. Part Two of this book will begin with a full-scale expose’ of the problems in the quantum model, and effectively wipe out the idea that our universe is composed of impersonal “particles.” But before we get to the larger discussions in this book, we wish to make a complete case for the existence of the aether, so that the reader is fully educated about its behavior as it relates to science and technology. So, even though our full treatment of quantum mechanics is still forthcoming, we will introduce certain concepts now since they will assist us in our discussion. 5.2  VIRTUAL PARTICLES  Any quantum physicist will now tell you that "virtual particles" have been discovered for all of the fundamental components of the atom- protons, neutrons and electrons. What "virtual" means is that they have concluded that even though these “particles” appear to be precisely the same as normal atomic components, they are not connected to any atom and they wink into and out of existence in very short periods of time! Even though this is a highly unusual discovery, they continue to see this simply as a function of particles. We have a “Big Bang” where Nothing exploded to become Something, and we now have all these particles scattered about to form the Universe, slowly running themselves down into “heat-death” extinction through the law of entropy, which states that everything must die: all order must dissolve into disorder. But now, when you introduce virtual particles in the mix, we also have to see particles that are appearing and disappearing moment by moment! Where do such particles exist when they are not a part of our 5 - Aether, Electromagnetism and Free Energy http://ascension2000.com/ConvergenceIII/c305.htm 2 of 16 11/1/2002 10:17 AM “three-dimensional” universe? Would this not be the reverse of entropy? This is certainly not a popular question to ask in the mainstream scientific world, which continues to humanize the Universe with our own issues. Since the destruction of the earth has become poignantly visible over the last century, it was natural for scientists to assert that the whole Universe was also slipping into inexorable decay. Fundamentally, it is a model without a Supreme Being of any kind – we are all stardust from a giant explosion that is now fizzling out like a spent bottle-rocket. So how did the idea of virtual particles get established? As a preview of our discussions in Part Two, we know that one of the two ways that we measure the quantum realm is with “magnetic particle tracking.” An excited burst of energy is entered into a chamber filled with a medium such as fluid or smoke that is illuminated, and the medium in the chamber allows an observer to see the track that the energy makes as it travels. By introducing a magnetic field into the area that is being measured, the energy will naturally travel in a curve, since we have long known that magnetic fields are always rotating and interacting with quantum energies. Based on the observation of the different kinds of tracks and how they behave, a set series of rules have been applied that allow these spiraling tracks to be interpreted as representing “protons,” “neutrons”, “electrons,” “quarks” or otherwise. So far, so good, it would appear. As the quantum physicists studied these tracks in closer detail, they realized that these tracks were not simply moving in smooth curving lines; very minor movements were occurring that caused the tracks to slightly bump back and forth as they moved. When they analyzed the areas where the “bumps” occurred, they found that these “bumps” followed the same rules that they applied for “particles:” protons, neutrons, electrons, et cetera. And now we have a problem: these “bumps” only occurred for very brief moments of time, even though they were happening constantly. So, since their model interpreted these movements as the behavior of “particles,” but their effects were only visible for extremely short periods of time, they concluded that these were “virtual particles.” In other words, they still insist that we must have particles, only now these particles are appearing and disappearing in our existence on a constant basis! So in the mind of the modern quantum physicist, you could be studying "empty space," have a proton suddenly show up and a few nanoseconds later it will disappear again. And these are not mere random oddities, either – we are talking about something that is happening constantly, everywhere we look, with an almost feverish intensity. This is definitely strange, and has certainly created even more problems for the contemporary quantum physicists to work with, based on the models that are now in place. If you still believe that there are “particles” in the Universe, then how do you explain a sea of particles that can simply be there one minute and gone the next? If the universe is simply composed of dead, 'empty' space, then where did these particles come from? Dr. Hal Puthoff explains that this bizarre behavior is due to the nature of the aether or "virtual particle flux" itself – the so-called “particles” are indeed emerging from the "energy of the vacuum." In a very simplified model of the aether as a fluid, virtual particles could also be seen as being created from a  fluid-type medium like water. Whereas an electron, proton or neutron may be seen as a stable, spherical, donut-shaped "whirlpool" in this flowing medium, such as our previous example in Chapter One involving a river, a virtual particle would simply represent a whirlpool that came and went very quickly - similar to how the ocean is constantly rolling and frothing at the surface. And thus it is the existence of virtual particles that gave birth to the concept of a "seething cauldron" or "raging sea" of energy. When we get into Part Two we will have a more complete explanation of quantum energy processes, but for now this is close enough to the aether model to allow us to continue the discussion. 5.3  THE CASIMIR FORCE The discovery of a "virtual particle flux" helps to explain the peculiarities of the "Casimir effect." This effect is demonstrated by the following experiment. First, you simply start the Faraday cage, which we remember as being an area that is shielded from all conventional energy fields, and you introduce a complete vacuum 5 - Aether, Electromagnetism and Free Energy http://ascension2000.com/ConvergenceIII/c305.htm 3 of 16 11/1/2002 10:17 AM inside. Then, inside that area you take two perfectly flat metallic plates and move them very, very close to each other. What do you think would happen? Nothing? We are quick to conclude that this simple experiment shouldn’t “do” anything, since we have examples of flat surfaces touching each other all around us. Why should it be any different if the surfaces are almost microscopically flat and contained in an airless space with no conventional force fields in it? Our intuition will not serve us well when we begin considering this problem, as there is indeed a very real and very powerful effect that takes place.  Under these circumstances, when the two plates are moved together, they will experience a terrific attraction that seems to pull them together with a tremendous amount of force! This is what is known as the "Casimir Force," named after the man who discovered it. This experimental effect also revealed that if you actually allow the two plates to completely merge, the force that binds them together is so powerful that you literally  have to destroy them to get them back apart. Now think about that for a minute; how would one explain a force that could "suck" two plates together? What would happen if every time you used your car, your shoes would get stuck to the pedals and you couldn't get them off? Driving would be a very dangerous proposition, especially if you were using a standard shift. That is a rough analogy of what is happening in this experiment, except that in the car there is no vacuum of air and energy and the surfaces of your shoe and the pedal are not flat enough to create the effect. Now something this simple should have already gotten more attention, and not be such an obscure tidbit of modern science. Most likely, it is not popular because it is a total anomaly that is very difficult to understand or explain with our current scientific models. In order for us to truly understand what is occurring, we will take a similar analogy cited by Ross Tessien, who asks us to visualize a suction cup. Ask yourself this question: What makes the suction cup attach to the surface? Most people would answer by saying that the cup will stick to a flat surface because it is "sucking" the material and thus attaching itself like glue. Sounds good, right?  However, it is totally the opposite! It is outside pressure and not suction that is responsible for this. Once you push a suction cup onto a flat surface, the edges will make a perfect seal over the surface that does not allow any air to get underneath. Once this seal is firmly established, you still have ten pounds per square inch of air pressure that is pushing down from the outside. So, it is actually the air pressure that is pushing the cup down, since there is now no air left on the inside to push against the cup in the opposite direction.  In zero-point energy theory, it is now believed that the Casimir force works in exactly the same way. This force is created when the distance between the plates becomes so narrow that no "virtual particles" or  aetheric energies are able to fit between them. So, there is no "sucking" going on at all; in fact it is a complete absence of energy that exists between the plates, aetheric or otherwise. And so, a form of "aether vacuum" is formed between the two plates, where no aether can flow inside the crack. Then, the surrounding "virtual particle flux" or aether pressure pushes the plates together from the outside! In Dr. Puthoff’s model, this pressure is believed to be caused by the “virtual particles” themselves, as they will continually emerge from  the zero-point energy long enough to exert a constant force upon the plates, thus pushing them together. Either way, it all comes back to a fundamentally aetheric design, and no other model seems to adequately explain why this incredibly powerful Casimir effect would occur. Bearing this in mind, we are continuing to see how the background aetheric energy plays a role in the world that we can observe. The Casimir effect reveals to us exactly how much pressure the aether is truly exerting on us. And yet, since Dr. Puthoff and most other theorists believe that it always "cancels out" to zero, we can never detect any major changes in the world around us. Just like the fishes in the sea, we end up saying, "Water? What water?" Indeed, think about this: do you ever stop and consider the fact that the atmosphere is putting ten pounds of pressure on every square inch of your body all the time? The pressures of the aether would be far greater, but normally speaking, they are undetectable. The force of inertia is only a vague reminder of how much pressure truly exists, when we consider the amount of energetic activity that is occurring at the quantum level. 5 - Aether, Electromagnetism and Free Energy http://ascension2000.com/ConvergenceIII/c305.htm 4 of 16 11/1/2002 10:17 AM So where do we find all this tremendous aetheric pressure, if it truly exists? Do we need to play around with metal plates and subatomic particles to see it, or do we have more familiar examples? As we continue to look at all aspects of aetheric science, magnetism ends up becoming one of the most interesting properties of all. In contemporary theory it is always fused together with the electrostatic force that creates electricity, but we can demonstrate that it is clearly a very different animal – and in Chapter 18 we will see that it has a very straightforward and yet undiscovered geometric identity. So here, we will cover the properties of magnetism, as ultimately they are very important in understanding the reality of the conscious aether and how it functions in our universe. If we want to understand this Ultimate Being, we must look at what our scientific findings have taught us, and assimilate that new information into our design. It is very simple for us to hear certain terms that have been defined scientifically and automatically separate them from any conceptualization of God – but if God truly exists, then all aspects of our Universe must be a part of this Being. 5.4  MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY      [Note: This diagram and others culled from Rockwell International's Reliance Electric website.] All of our conventional theories about magnetism and electricity did have their origin in aetheric models, since much of the research was done in the 1800’s when these models were still in vogue. The "flux lines" formed by the force from a magnet, which we shall discuss below, were once believed to actually represent a physical substance that could be "cut" and harnessed. Even though the aetheric models could suggest that the magnets were drawing energy from the aether itself, the original physicists still believed that the force created by a magnet existed within the magnet itself, not as a force that was being pulled from the surrounding energy of "empty space." This viewpoint has not changed in all the time since it was formulated; however, we will suggest that it must be in error, and the aetheric model provides us with a perfect alternative. In the experiments with psychokinesis cited in Chapter Two, both electricity and magnetism could be created and controlled by nothing more than the focus of consciousness – and if the consciousness of the others in the room was predominantly negative, the effect was much more draining on the subject. Furthermore, the energy surrounding Nina Kulagina's body would lose half of its strength when she performed these feats, certainly suggesting that she was somehow able to draw in the aetheric energy from around her and use her body to send and transmute it to the object. So if the energy of magnetism can be created from sheer conscious  thought alone, it would be difficult to ascribe it to a force that simply exists within the magnet itself. Magnetism can be created just like gravity and electricity, straight from the consciousness of this Ultimate Being itself – and in the case of Kulagina, it occurs spontaneously around the object in question, with no measurable line of force connecting it to the person inducing the activity. It literally arises "from the aethers" 5 - Aether, Electromagnetism and Free Energy http://ascension2000.com/ConvergenceIII/c305.htm 5 of 16 11/1/2002 10:17 AM at the point where it is needed. 5.4.1  E-FIELD AND B-FIELD Magnetism and electricity are considered to be two components of the same force, namely electromagnetism. Magnetism is referred to as the "B-field" and electricity as the "E-field," and they are graphed out as a unified wave where the E-field is on the horizontal plane and the B-field is on the vertical plane, 90 degrees of rotation away from its counterpart. This is based upon careful measurements of the properties of these fields themselves, and is considered to be a contemporary fact. The picture below shows us a "conventionalized diagram of an (electromagnetic) wave form…" that was reprinted by Enterprise Mission with permission from Ultra High Frequency Radio Engineering by WL Emory, The Macmillan Company.    This diagram allows us to clearly see the observed interplay between the two forces. As we look at the picture, we can see that the two fields are in a constant 90-degree relationship to each other. This is called an “orthogonal” relationship, and it will become very important when we start looking at the theories surrounding the idea of higher “dimensions” of space. Since the electromagnetic wave forms the basis of our Universe, all theorists who study the concepts of higher dimensions believe that each higher dimension must somehow be located at another 90-degree turn away from the three main axes of length, width and height that we now see! If this sounds confusing or impossible to you, then you’re on the right track! No matter where you turn a corner and rotate 90 degrees, you’re still going to end up in what we would call “three-space.” This puzzling conclusion of the existence of “higher dimensions” has come from the “crystal ball” of mathematics. Certain equations demonstrate that there must somehow be a way for energy to have “more room” to travel through than what we see in our own “three-space.” However, this doesn’t make it any easier to visualize. Mathematics can often be used to propose solutions to problems without giving us a solid visual model to work with. When we start looking at Rod Johnson’s model in Chapter 18, we will see that there is a very good reason for the shape of this waveform; it ultimately reveals a hidden geometry inside of itself, and this geometry was independently discovered by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19 th  century and again by Buckminster Fuller, who announced it to the world at his Planet Planning address in 1969. Johnson was unfamiliar with these earlier discoveries when he independently determined that the same geometric form was being described by the electromagnetic wave. This unseen geometric structure will prove to be a crucial part of truly understanding how the consciousness of this Ultimate Being forms all of reality that we know, from its own “body.” 5.4.2  DYNAMIC FORCE, STATIC ENERGY Let us not forget how important this wave really is; it is the primary means through which the energy of the universe is expressed. Another important and puzzling aspect of the behavior of this waveform is that the two  components do not at all move in the same fashion. Michael Faraday was the first to determine that magnetic

Comprende desde bocetos autobiográficos hasta tentativas de explicar a través de  la filosofía de la ciencia el interés que siento por la ciencia y el universo. El libro  concluye con la reproducción de una entrevista que me hicieron para el programa  de radio Discos de la Isla Desierta. En este programa, institución típicamente  británica, solicitan al invitado que se imagine arrojado a una isla desierta y  obligado a elegir ocho discos que escuchará hasta su rescate. Por fortuna, no tuve  que esperar demasiado para volver a la civilización.    Como estos trabajos fueron redactados durante un periodo de dieciséis años,  reflejan el estado de mis conocimientos en cada momento (confío en que hayan  aumentado a lo largo del tiempo). Indico por eso la fecha y ocasión en que los  escribí. Cada uno fue desarrollado aisladamente: es inevitable, pues, que haya  cierto número de repeticiones. He tratado de eliminarlas, pero subsisten algunas.    Varios de estos textos fueron concebidos para ser leídos en publico. Mi expresión  era tan deficiente que en conferencias y seminarios recurría a la ayuda de otra  persona, por lo general, uno de los estudiantes que investigaban conmigo y que  era capaz de entenderme, o que leía un texto redactado por mí, pues en 1985  sufrí una operación que me privó por completo de la voz. Por un tiempo carecí de  todo medio de comunicación; luego me equiparon con un sistema informático y un  excelente sintetizador de la voz. Para mi gran sorpresa, descubrí entonces que  podía tener éxito como orador ante grandes audiencias. Disfruto con mis  explicaciones científicas y dando respuesta a las preguntas que me formulan.  Estoy seguro de que aun me queda mucho que aprender, pero creo que hago  progresos. El lector juzgara por si mismo a lo largo de estas paginas.    No estoy de acuerdo con la idea de que el universo constituye un misterio que  cabe intuir pero que jamás llegaremos a analizar o a comprender plenamente.  Considero que esa opinión no hace justicia a la revolución científica iniciada hace  casi cuatro siglos por Galileo y desarrollada por Newton. Ellos demostraron que  algunas áreas del universo no se comportaban de manera arbitraria sino que se  hallaban gobernadas por leyes matemáticas precisas. Desde entonces y a lo largo  de los años hemos ampliado la obra de Galileo y de Newton a casi todas las áreas  del universo y ahora tenemos leyes matemáticas que gobiernan todo lo que  experimentamos normalmente. Prueba de nuestro éxito es que disponemos de  millones de dólares para construir máquinas gigantescas que aceleran partículas  que alcanzan una energía tal que aun ignoramos lo que sucederá cuando estas  Agujeros Negros y Pequeños Universos                                                                   Stephen Hawking   4 choquen. Esas velocísimas partículas no existen en las situaciones terrestres  normales por lo que, en consecuencia, podría parecer meramente académico e  innecesario invertir tanto dinero en su estudio. Pero tuvieron que existir en el  universo primitivo y, por tanto, hemos de averiguar lo que sucede con tales  energías si queremos comprender como comenzamos nosotros y el universo.    Todavía es mucho lo que no sabemos o entendemos acerca del universo; mas el  gran progreso logrado, sobre todo en los últimos cien años, debe estimularnos a  creer que no se halla fuera de nuestro alcance un entendimiento pleno. Quizá no  estemos condenados a avanzar siempre a tientas en la oscuridad. Puede que  lleguemos a contar con una teoría completa y, en ese caso, seriamos desde luego  dueños del universo.    Los artículos científicos de este volumen fueron escritos conforme a la idea de que  el universo se halla gobernado por un orden que ahora podemos percibir  parcialmente y que quizá comprenderemos por entero en un futuro no demasiado  lejano. Tal vez esta esperanza sea simplemente un espejismo, y que no exista una  teoría definitiva o que, de haberla, no seamos capaces de descubrirla. Pero  pugnar por conseguirla es, con seguridad, mejor que desesperar de la capacidad  de la mente humana.

Calculo que aquel día vinieron al mundo doscientos mil bebes más.  Ignore si alguno de ellos se interesó luego por la astronomía. Nací en Oxford,  aunque mis padres vivían en Londres, porque durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial,  Oxford resultaba un lugar conveniente para nacer: los alemanes habían accedido  a no bombardear Oxford ni Cambridge a cambio de que los británicos no  bombardeasen Heidelberg ni Gotinga. Es una lástima que este tipo de acuerdo  civilizado no se haya extendido a otras ciudades.    Mi padre procedía de Yorkshire. Su abuelo, mi bisabuelo, un rico hacendado,  adquirió demasiadas granjas y quebró durante la depresión agrícola de comienzos  de siglo. Eso dejó en mala situación a los padres de mi progenitor, pero de  cualquier modo consiguieron enviarle a Oxford, donde estudio medicina. Luego se  dedico a la investigación de enfermedades tropicales. En 1935 partió para África  oriental. Cuando empezó la guerra cruzó toda África por tierra para alcanzar un  barco que lo regreso a Inglaterra. Se presentó voluntario para el servicio militar,  pero le dijeron que resultaría más valioso en la investigación médica.    Mi madre nació en Glasgow, Escocia. Fue la segunda de siete hermanos, hijos de  un médico de cabecera. La familia se trasladó al sur, a Devon, cuando ella tenía  doce años y, aunque tampoco andaban sobrados de dinero, como la familia de mi  padre, consiguieron enviarla a Oxford. Desempeñó varios empleos, incluyendo el  de inspectora de hacienda, que no le gustaba. Renunció para hacerse secretaria.  Entonces conoció a mi padre, en los primeros años de la guerra.    Vivíamos en Highgate, en el norte de Londres. Mi hermana Mary nació dieciocho  meses después que yo. Me dijeron que no me entusiasmo su llegada. A lo largo  de nuestra niñez existió entre nosotros una tensión, alimentada por la escasa  diferencia de edad, que desapareció ya de adultos, cuando seguimos caminos  diversos. Estudió medicina, lo que complació a mi padre. Mi hermana pequeña,  Philippa, nació cuando yo tenia casi cinco años y podía entender lo que sucedía.  Soy capaz de recordar como esperaba su nacimiento para que fuéramos tres a la  hora de jugar. Fue una niña muy vehemente y perceptiva. Siempre respeté su  criterio y sus opiniones. Mi hermano Edward llego mucho más tarde, cuando yo                                                    1 Este artículo y el siguiente están basados en una charla que pronuncié en septiembre de  1987, en la reunión de la Internacional Motor Neurone Disease Society, en Zurich, así como  en textos redactados en agosto de 1991.    
Fisica Einstein's Physics Of Illusion Copyright © 1980 by John Dobson This essay was delivered by John Dobson as a lecture at the Vedanta Society, Berkeley, USA, on 12th October 1980 and has been reprinted from: The Vedanta Kesari   May, 1988 (pages 181-189) Some of you may think from the title "Einstein's Physics of Illusion", that I'm going to talk about the physics which underlies what we think of as magic. That is not what I expect to talk about. Some of you may think that I suspect that Einstein had some special physics of illusions. If he did, I don't know anything of it. Instead, what I want to do, with Einstein's help, is to trace our physics all the way back to square one, and to find out whether, underlying it, there may possibly be something akin to magic. George Valens has written a charming book called The Attractive Universe.   It is subtitled "Gravity and the Shape of Space", and on the very first page he says that when a ball is thrown straight up, after a while it comes to a stop, changes its direction and comes back. He says it looks like magic, and probably it is. Now what he is taking for granted is that it should have gone off on a straight path without any change in speed or direction. But you see, that also   would have been the result of magic. We do not understand in physics why   the ball comes back. But we also   do not understand in our physics why   the ball should have continued without any change in the direction of its speed. Now in the title, and in the remarks that I have made so far, what I mean by magic or illusion is something like what happens when, in the twilight, you mistake a rope for a snake. And this sort of thing was analyzed very carefully by some people in North India long, long ago, and they said that when you make such a mistake there are three aspects to your mistake. First, you must fail to see the rope rightly. Then, instead of seeing it as a rope, you must see it as something else. And finally, you had to see the rope in first place or you never would have mistaken it for" a snake. You mistook it for a snake because the rope was three feet long, and you're accustomed to three foot long snakes. But before I speak further about illusion, I want to say a few words about what we do   understand in physics, and I also want to point out a few gaps in that understanding. When we talk about the universe, or when we look out and see it, what we see is that the universe is made out of what we call matter. It's what we call a material universe. And what we want to do, first of all, is to trace that material back, not quite to square one, but to square two at least, We want to find out whether we can think of all these things which we see as being made out of matter, as really   being made out of only a few ingredients. And the answer is that we can. Long ago the chemists pointed out that all these things that we see are made out of not more than 92 ingredients. Those are the 92 chemical elements of the periodic table. It was suggested in 1815 that all those different chemical elements are probably made out of hydrogen. That was Prout's hypothesis, because in those days no one knew how to do it. But now, in modern times, Einstein's Physics Of Illusion http://www.magicpubs.com/dobson/PhysicsOfIllusion.html (1 of 9) [5/27/1999 8:48:53 PM] we do   know how to do it, and we do   know that that's what happens. All the other chemical elements are made out of hydrogen, and it happens in the stars" The universe, even as it is today, consists mostly of hydrogen. And what it is doing is falling together in the gravitational field. It falls together to galaxies and stars, and the stars are hot. Falling together by gravity is what makes them hot. And they get hot enough inside so that the hydrogen is converted to.helium. Now helium is a very strong atomic nucleus, and so the main line in building up the atoms of the atomic table goes this way: First, four hydrogens make one helium. Then three heliums make one carbon. Two heliums won't stick. That would be beryllium-8. There is no beryllium-8. It won't last. But three heliums will   stick, and that's carbon. Four is oxygen. Five is neon. That's the way it goes in the stars; the other nuclei are built of helium nuclei. Six makes magnesium. Then silicon, sulfur, argon, calcium, titanium, chromium and iron. In big stars it goes like this. But in small stars like our sun it goes only up to carbon or possibly carbon and oxygen. That's where our sun will end, at about the size of the earth, but with a density of about four concrete mixing trucks in a one pint jar. Larger stars get too hot by their own gravitational squeeze, and the carbon cannot cool off like that. They go right on to oxygen and so on, until they get, in the center, to iron. Now iron is the dumbest stuff in the universe. There is no nuclear energy available to iron -- nothing by which it can fight back against gravitational collapse; so gravity collapses it, this time to the density of a hundred thousand airplane carriers squeezed into a one pint yogurt box One hundred thousand airplane carriers in a one pint box! And, when it collapses like that, the gravitational energy that is released to other forms blows the outer portions of the star all over the galaxy. That's the stuff out of which our bodies are made. Our bodies are all made out of star dust from such exploding stars. We do know   that the main ingredient of the universe is hydrogen and that the main usable energy in the universe is gravitational. We know   that the name of the game is falling together by gravity (hydrogen, falling together by gravity), but what we don't know is why   things fall together by gravity. We do know   that the stuff out of which this universe is made is hydrogen, but we do not know from where   we get the hydrogen. We know   that the hydrogen is made of electrical particles, protons and electrons, and we know that the total electrical charge of the universe is zero, but we do not know, you see, why   it is made of electricity. We do not know why   it falls together. And we do not know why,   when things are moving, they should coast. There are these gaps in our understanding. We know how   things coast. We know how   things fall. We know how   the electrical particles behave, but we don't know any of the why   questions. We don't have any answers to the why   questions. What I want to talk about next is a discovery made by Albert Einstein when he was 26 years old and working in the patent office in Bern. Then I want to talk about the" consequences of that discovery and, through that, I want to trace our physics back, if possible, to answer those why   questions. Einstein noticed that we cannot have an objective universe in three dimensions. We all talk about 3-D. Hardly anybody talks about 4-D. But the universe is 4-D. It is not possible to have a universe of space without a universe of time. It is not possible to have space without time, or time without space, because space and time are opposites.   I don't know that Einstein ever used the language that space and time are opposites, but if you look at his equations, it is very, very clear that that's exactly what they are. If, between two events, the space separation between them is the same as the time separation between them, then the total separation between them is zero. That's what we mean by opposites in this case. In electricity if we have the same amount of plus charges as we have of minus charges, say in the same Einstein's Physics Of Illusion http://www.magicpubs.com/dobson/PhysicsOfIllusion.html (2 of 9) [5/27/1999 8:48:53 PM] atom or the same molecule, then that atom or that molecule is neutral. There is no charge seen from outside. Likewise here. If the space separation between, two events is just the same as the time separation between those two events, then the total separation between those two events is zero. I'll give you an example. Suppose we see an exploding star, say in the Andromeda galaxy. There's one going on there right now. It's been visible for about a month or so. Now the Andromeda galaxy is two and a quarter million light years away, and when we see the explosion now, we see it as it was two and a quarter million years ago. You see, the space separation and the time separation are the same, which means that the total separation between you and what you see is zero. The total   separation, the real   separation, the objective   separation, that is, the separation as seen by anybody,   between the event which you see and the event of your seeing it -- the separation between those two events is always zero. What we mean when we say that the space and time separations between two events are equal is that light could get from one of those events to the other in vacuum. We see things out there, and we think they're really out there. But, you see, we cannot see them when they happen. We can't see anything when it happens. We see everything in the past. We see everything a little while ago, and always in such a way that the while ago just balances the distance away, and the separation between the perceiver and the perceived remains always at zero. As soon as Einstein noticed that we cannot have a universe of space without a universe of time and vice versa, and that they are connected in this way, and that the only way to have an objective universe is in four dimensions, and not in two or three or one -- as soon as he noticed that, he had to redo our physics. Now relativity theory is a geometry theory. It's not something else. It's a geometry theory. It's about the geometry of the real world. I'm sure that most if not all of you have been exposed, somewhere along your educational careers, to the geometry of Euclid. His geometry is in two dimensions and in three, but he didn't have any idea about introducing the fourth dimension. His geometry - is a theoretical   geometry about a theoretical   space which does not, in fact, exist. Newton based his understanding of physics also on that understanding of geometry, and Newton's physics is a theoretical   physics about a theoretical   universe which does not, in fact, exist. We know now, you see, that Euclid was wrong in his understanding of geometry, and that Newton was likewise wrong in his understanding of physics. And we had to correct our physics in terms of Einstein's re-understanding of geometry. It was when Einstein went through our physics with his new understanding of geometry that he saw that what we had been calling matter or mass or inertia is really just energy. It is just potential energy. It had been suggested a few years earlier by Swami Vivekananda that what we call matter could be reduced to potential energy. In about 1895 he writes in a letter that he is to go the following week to see Mr. Nikola Tesla who thinks he can demonstrate it mathematically. Without Einstein's understanding of geometry, however, Tesla apparently failed. It was from the geometry that Einstein saw that what we call rest mass, that which is responsible for the heaviness of things and for their resistance to being shaken, is really just energy. Einstein's famous equation is E = mc 2 . Probably most of you have seen that equation. It says that for a particle at rest, its mass is equal to its energy. Those of you who read Einstein know that there is no "c" in that equation. The c 2  is just in case your units of space and time don't match. If you've chosen to measure space in an arbitrary unit and time in another arbitrary unit, and if you have not taken the trouble to connect the two units, then, for your system you have to put in the c 2 . If you're going to measure space in centimeters, then time must not be measured in seconds. It must be measured in jiffies. A jiffy is the length of time it Einstein's Physics Of Illusion http://www.magicpubs.com/dobson/PhysicsOfIllusion.html (3 of 9) [5/27/1999 8:48:53 PM] takes light to go one centimeter. Astronomers are rather broad minded people, and they have noticed that the universe is quite a bit too big to be measured conveniently in centimeters, and quite a bit too old to be measured conveniently in seconds; so they measure the time in years and the distance in light-years, and the units correspond. That "c" in the equation is the speed of light in your system of units, and if you've chosen years and light-years then the speed of light in your system is one. And if you square it, it's still one, and the equation doesn't change. The equation simply says that energy and mass are the same thing. Our problem now is that if we're going to trace this matter back, and find out what it is, we have first of all to find out what kind of energy makes it massive. Now we have only a few kinds of energy to choose from. Fortunately there are only a few: gravitational energy, kinetic energy, radiation, electricity, magnetism and nuclear energy. But I must allay your suspicion that nuclear energy might be very important. It is not. The nuclear energy available in this universe is very small. If all the matter in the universe began as hydrogen gas and ended as iron, then the nuclear energy released in that change (and that is the maximum nuclear energy available) is only one per cent of what you can get by letting that hydrogen fall together by gravity. So nuclear energy is not a big thing, and we have only five kinds of energy to choose from in order to find out what kind of energy makes the primordial hydrogen hard to shake. That, you remember, was our problem. What we want is potential energy, because the hydrogen is hard to shake even when it's not doing a thing. So what we're after is potential energy, and that restricts it quite a bit more. Radiation has nothing to do with that. Radiation never stands still. And kinetic energy never stands still. And even magnetic energy never stands still. So we are left with electricity and gravity. There are only two. We don't have any choice at all. There is just the gravitational energy and the electrical energy of this universe available to make this universe as heavy or as massive as we find it. Now I should remind you that the amount of energy we're talking about is very large. It's five hundred atom bombs per pound. One quart of yogurt, on the open market, is worth one thousand atom bombs. It just happens that we're not in the open market place. We live where we have no way to get the energy of that yogurt to change form to kinetic energy or radiation so that we can do anything with it. It's tied up in there in such a way that we can't get it out. But right now we're going to talk about the possibility   of getting it out. We want to talk about how this tremendous energy is tied up in there. We want to talk about how this matter is "wound up". First let's talk about watches. We know how they're wound up. They're wound up against a spring. Now when we wind up a watch, what I want to know is whether it gets heavier or lighter. If we have a watch, and if we wind it up, does it get harder to shake or easier? It gets harder to shake because when we wind it up we put more potential energy into it, and energy is the only thing in the universe that's hard to shake. So now we want to know in what way the whole universe is wound up to make it heavy and hard to shake. We know that it must be wound up against electricity and gravity. The question is: How? We need to know some details on how to wind things up. How, for instance, do you wind up against gravity? You wind against gravity by pulling things apart in the gravitational field. They all want to go back together again. And if the entire universe were to fall together to a single blob, the gravitational energies that would be released to other forms would be five hundred atom bombs per pound. The universe is wound up on gravitational energy just by being spaced away from itself against the gravitational pull inward. And it turns out to be just the right amount. It really does account for the fact that it's five hundred atom bombs per pound. Einstein's Physics Of Illusion http://www.magicpubs.com/dobson/PhysicsOfIllusion.html (4 of 9) [5/27/1999 8:48:53 PM] How do we wind up against electricity? We push like charges toward each other. If you push two electrons toward each other you have to do work, and it gets heavier or more massive. If you push two protons toward each other it gets more massive. And if you take a single electrical charge and make it very small, since you're pushing like charge toward itself, it too becomes more massive. Now it turns out that the work that's represented by a smallness of all the teeny-weeny particles that make up the hydrogen atoms and all the rest of this stuff is, once again, five hundred atom bombs per pound. Some of you might think that it should come out to a total of ten hundred atom bombs per pound -- five hundred gravitational and five hundred electrical. No, it's only five hundred atom bombs per pound because winding it up one way is exactly   the same thing as winding it up the other way. Coins have two sides, heads and tails. You cannot make coins with only one side. For every heads there is a tails. Plus and minus charges are like heads and tails. Space and time are like heads and tails. And electricity and gravity are like heads and tails. You cannot space things away from each other in the gravitational field without making them small in the electrical field. I think that we're ready now to attack the consequences of this new understanding of physics. We want to find out whether, through this understanding, we can trace our physics all the way back to square one, to see whether, underlying it, there may be something akin to magic. We want to know why things fall. We want the answers to our why questions. I'm going to draw you a quick map. This is a picture of the physics before Einstein: Mass Space Energy Time In the last century we thought that mass was one thing; energy was another. Space was one thing; time was another. In our present understanding of physics that won't work. Space and time are just two sides of the same coin. Mass and energy are just two sides of the same coin. And there is no line through there: Mass Energy Space Time There is no line between mass and energy or between space and time. And we just talked about the way in which the universe is wound up in order to make the particles massive. They're wound up against space. They're spaced in   against the electrical field, and they're spaced out   against the gravitational field, which means that what we call matter and energy are also nothing but geometry, and the line down the middle goes too. But when the lines go, the picture goes. When the lines of demarcation between mass and energy and space and time are obliterated, we do not   have a model of a physical universe. Every definition in our physics, every concept in our physics. requires measurements of length. or of Einstein's Physics Of Illusion http://www.magicpubs.com/dobson/PhysicsOfIllusion.html (5 of 9) [5/27/1999 8:48:53 PM] 
Fisica 1 Algebraic Quantum Mechanics, Algebraic Spinors and Hilbert Space. B. J. Hiley. Theoretical Physics Research Unit, Birkbeck, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HX. b.hiley@bbk.ac.uk Abstract. The orthogonal Clifford algebra and the generalised Clifford algebra, Cn, (discrete Weyl algebra) is re-examined and it is shown that the quantum mechanical wave function (element of left ideal), density operator (element of a two sided ideal) and mean values (algebraic trace) can be constructed from entirely within the algebra.  No appeal to Hilbert space is necessary. We show how the GNS construction can be obtained from within both algebras. The limit of Cn as n? ? is shown to be the extended Heisenberg algebra.  Finally the relationship to the usual Hilbert space approach is discussed.  1.  Introduction. In my study of the structure of Clifford algebras particularly in regard to the role they play in quantum mechanics through Pauli spinors, the Dirac spinors and Penrose's twistors, I was struck by how all the relevant results could be accounted for from within the algebra.  There was no need to leave the algebra and to construct an external Hilbert space upon which the elements of the algebra were deemed to act when they play the role of observables.  Of course all of these algebras are finite and non-nilpotent so that they are easily treated by standard algebraic analysis.  My original thoughts on these topics can be found in Frescura and Hiley (1980, 1984 and 1987). However when it comes to the Heisenberg algebra these techniques appear not to be applicable because this algebra is nilpotent.  However the earlier work of Schönberg (1957) and the later ideas of Frescura and Hiley (1989) and Hiley (1991) suggested there was such a possibility provided one extended the algebra (Hiley 2001).  Considerable 2 clarification of the meaning of this specific extension has been achieved by exploring the finite discrete Weyl algebra1 Cn. (Morris 1967 and Hiley and Monk 1993). The importance of these algebras for topic of discussion in this paper is that in the limit as n ? ? the algebra contains the Heisenberg algebra.  These algebras are finite so that the same techniques used in Clifford algebras can be directly applied.  Thus we have a unified way of dealing with the basic algebras that lie at the heart of quantum mechanics. These results have only intensified my curiosity as to why most if not all of the results can be obtained without seemingly the need to resort to Hilbert space. This goes against the prevailing orthodoxy that appears to insist that quantum mechanics cannot be done except in the context of a Hilbert space.  Yet there have been other voices raised against the necessity of Hilbert space.  Von Neumann himself wrote to Birkoff (1966) writing "I would like to make a confession which may seem immoral: I do not believe absolutely in Hilbert space any more."  (A detailed discussion of why von Neumann made this comment can be found in Rédei 1996). But there are more important reasons why an algebraic approach has advantages. As Dirac (1965) has stressed, when algebraic methods are used for systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom (e.g., field theory), we can obtain solutions to some physical problems that give no solution in the usual Schrödinger picture.  This possibility arises because in these systems the equivalence between the Schrödinger representation and the Heisenberg representation no longer holds.  Indeed in field theory there is no longer one unique representation.  There exist many inequivalent representations and these give rise to more general structures as has been pointed out by Emch (1972) and more recently in Haag (1992). These works are of a more mathematical nature but from the point of view of physics what emerges is that the density operator, , rather than the wave function, plays a fundamental role.  This means we have a natural way of describing more general quantum processes that involve, for example, thermal systems. Systems described by wave functions then correspond to the special case when 2 =  which means the system is effectively at zero temperature.  But it is not merely a question of the appearance of non-zero temperatures.  As Prigogine (1994) has already pointed out, nonintegrable systems give rise to diffusive terms that correspond to the symmetry breaking in time. Such systems cannot be described in terms of wave functions.  The only possible way of describing such systems is through the density operator.                                                  1 These algebras are called generalised Clifford algebras by Morris (1967) 3 While all the important new features that arise in the algebraic approach involve an infinite number of degrees of freedom even in the case of systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom we find new features that are rarely discussed in the physics literature.  One such example, which we shall discuss later, is the appearance of algebraic spinors.  We show that these spinors are a generalisation of the ordinary spinor, which have new mathematical implications that are ignored in the usual approach. This generalisation is not only an enrichment of the mathematics.  Following on from the work of Frescura and Hiley (1980a, 1980b), Monk and Hiley (1998) have pointed out that the algebra provides a very different perspective on the nature of quantum processes.  In fact by emphasising the purely algebraic aspect of the approach we remove the distinction between operator and operand and this allows us to provide an interpretation in terms of the notion of process rather than in terms of particles and/or fields in interaction. These ideas were developed to explore connections with non-commutative geometry but we will not develop these ideas here (See Hiley 1991). Indeed it is not the purpose of this paper to attempt to justify this more general and speculative position here.  Rather we want to explore the mathematical consequences of adopting this more general position by bringing out its relationship to the usual approach, a feature that is generally lost in the many details provided, for example, in excellent two volume treatise by Bratteli and Robinson (1979).  In particular we want to present a simpler approach through which we can see what results depend only on the structure of the abstract algebra, what features depend on a specific representation, usually a matrix representation, and what features require the construction of a Hilbert space. To maintain generality we start by recalling the main properties of an abstract * algebra. We then show a how a measure, ?, called a weight is introduced, which plays the role of the state. ? is a functional, mapping elements of the algebra onto the real field. It is not difficult to show that this is equivalent to introducing the density operator in the usual approach To motivate the approach we first explore the orthogonal Clifford algebra by showing how primitive idempotents play a crucial role in this approach.  We use these idempotents can be used to construct minimal left and right ideals.  These ideals are spanned by algebraic spinors and these elements play the role of 'wave functions' in the Hilbert space formalism.  But it must be emphasised these elements are contained entirely within the algebra and no external vector space is needed.  We have already stressed this point in Frescura and Hiley (1980a).  In this paper we show how these same ideals are generated in the standard algebraic approaches described in Haag (1992), and in Emch 4 (1972). As the aim of this paper is mainly pedagogic, we rely heavily on the theorems proved in those volumes, particularly the latter and will not reproduce them here.  We then go on to illustrate how these methods can be to specific example that use two of the simplest Clifford algebra R1,1 and H.  R1,1 is the Clifford algebra of a relativistic space- time with one space dimension while H is the quaternion algebra.  We choose these not for physical reasons but because they are the simplest examples in which to demonstrate the principles involved.  We also show how the density operator is constructed and the role it plays in the whole structure. We then widen the discussion to the discrete Weyl algebra Cn (Weyl 1931 and Monk and Hiley 1993) ultimately generalising to the symplectic Clifford algebra (Crumeyrolle 1990).  This enables us to extend the discussion to include the Heisenberg algebra. We bring out clearly what is involved in this structure by first exploring C3. In the mathematics literature this gives the structure of the nonions first introduced as a generalisation of the quaternion many years ago by Sylvester (1884).  As the generalisation to higher n is straight forward but tedious we finally discuss the limit as n ?? to include the Heisenberg algebra to make contact with standard quantum mechanics.  In doing this we show how the algebraic approach is related to the Hilbert space approach. Finally we show how the density matrix can be written as a vector in a higher dimensional space, which can be mapped into a Hilbert space.  This is the so-called GNS construction, which arises in a very straightforward manner in the algebraic approach. We are then immediately able to connect up with the thermal field theory approach of Umezawa (1993) that exploits the rich properties of bialgebras.  Physically this approach allows a description of the thermal properties of quantum processes. 2.  The Algebra. Since our main intention of the paper is pedagogical we begin by outlining the properties of the general algebra within which we will work.   Recall that a linear algebra, A, is a vector space with (i) addition A + B ? A, (ii) multiplication by a scalar, A ? A,  is an element of the real or complex field, (iii) together with a product AB ? A.  We will assume the product to be associative. Furthermore we will initially consider the algebra to be of finite rank, n, with a finite basis {ei}. 5 Since we require the analogue of a Hermitian conjugate we assume the algebra, A, is equipped with an involutive anti-automorphism defined by *: A ? A with the following properties : For  ? A, B ? A (A*)* = A, ( A)* = *A*  ? C (A + B)* = A* + B* (AB)* = B*A* We will further assume the following two requirements are satisfied, (1)  For each A ? A, ? B in A such that A*A = B (2)  A*A = 0 ? A = 0. So as not worry too much about the abstract nature of this algebra, it is useful to keep in mind a matrix algebra with Hermitian conjugation defined. 3. The Density Operator. 3.1 The Algebraic preliminaries. We need some way of obtaining numbers from this algebra that will allow us to identify with expectation values used in quantum mechanics.  We use a analogous method to that used in set theory by introducing a functional  such that : A ? ? or C ? A ? A such that (A) = ,  ? ? or C  is a positive linear functional (called the expectation or state functional) satisfying, ( A + B) = (A) + ( ); ( A) = (A) and (A*A) ? 0 If the algebra has a unit, 1, then we choose (1) = 1. This means that the state is normalsed. The collection of all linear functionals over A forms the dual space A* of the algebra. Now for ? A ? A, we have a real or complex number (A) depending linearly on A with (A*A) ? 0.  This enables us to define a Hermitian scalar product through

These issues play an important role especially in the context of non-linear, di eo- morphism invariant theories such as general relativity. Recently, an extension of the required type was proposed by one of us using algebraic quantization methods. In this paper, the key conceptual and technical aspects of the algebraic program are illustrated through a number of  nite dimensional examples. The choice of examples and some of the analysis is motivated by certain peculiar problems en- demic to quantum gravity. However, prior knowledge of general relativity is not assumed in the main discussion. Indeed, the methods introduced and conclusions arrived at are applicable to any system with  rst class constraints. In particular, they resolve certain technical issues which are present also in the reduced phase space approach to quantization of these systems. 1 Introduction A number of systems with  rst class constraints arise naturally in mathematical physics: interesting examples are provided by Yang-Mills theories, general relativity, string the- ory and topological  eld theories. The problem of non-perturbative quantization of such theories is of considerable interest from both physical and mathematical perspectives. In the case of QCD for example, one hopes that a non-perturbative quantization would provide a satisfactory explanation of the physical phenomenon of con nement. Simi- larly, a full quantization of topological  eld theories is expected to provide a wealth of information on the topology of low dimensional manifolds as well as a classi cation of knots. 1 There are two major avenues to the non-perturbative quantization of such systems. The  rst is the Dirac approach, in which, roughly speaking, one  rst ignores the con- straints, quantizes the system and then selects the admissible physical states by demand- ing that they be annihilated by the quantum constraint operators. The second is the reduced phase space method where one  rst eliminates the constraints classically and then quantizes the resulting unconstrained system. In this paper, we shall focus on the Dirac method although some of the main points we raise and the conclusions we reach are relevant also to the reduced phase space method. In an algebraic version of the Dirac quantization procedure [1] {essentially the one followed originally by Dirac{ one  rst ignores the constraints and constructs a \kine- matical" operator algebra A starting from the phase space of the system. One then seeks a representation ofAby operators acting on a complex vector space V. Next, one represents the constraints as concrete operators on the chosen vector space. Imposition of constraints is then carried out by  nding the kernel of the constraint operators. Since the operators are all linear, the kernel Vphy has a natural vector space structure. This is the space of physical states and elements of A which map V to itself are the physical operators. In simple physical systems, one can carry out this program completely. For source-free Maxwell  elds in Minkowski space, for example, the algebra A is generated by ^A(g) := Rd3x ^Aa(x)ga(x) and ^E(f) := R d3x^Ea(x)fa(x), the smeared vector poten- tials and electric  elds. For the vector space V, one can choose the space of functionals of vector potentials  (A), represent ^A(g) by a multiplication operator and ^E(f) by a (directional) derivative (in the direction of fa). One then imposes the Gauss constraint:R d3x ^Ea@a   (A) = 0 for all suitably regular functions  (x). This equation can be readily solved. It tells us that  (A) must be gauge invariant. Thus, as one might expect, the space Vphy of physical states is precisely the space of gauge invariant functions of vector potentials. This general procedure, however, is incomplete. The most signi cant limitation is that it leaves open the issue of  nding the inner product on the space Vphy of physical states; no prescription what so ever is provided. In practice, one generally appeals to suitable symmetries and asks that the inner product be such that these symmetries are unitarily implemented in the quantum theory. In the above example of free Maxwell  elds, the required symmetries are provided by the Poincar e group acting on the un- derlying Minkowski space-time. However, an appropriate symmetry group is not always available. In the case of general relativity, for example, there is no background space- time and hence no analog of the Poincar e group1. One might imagine using the entire di eomorphism group. However, just as the quantum constraint of Maxwell theory re- quires that all physical states be gauge invariant, those of general relativity require that they all be di eomorphism invariant. The di eomorphism group thus has a trivial action on Vphy; it is unitary with respect to any inner product! Thus, the fact that there is no prescription available to  nd the inner product is a severe limitation, especially in the context of di eomorphism invariant theories. 1One might seek symmetries directly on the in nite dimensional phase space. However, it is known that appropriate symmetries fail to exist. For 4-dimensional general relativity, see [2, 3]. The results of [2] also hold in 3-dimensional relativity[4]. 2 A second limitation arises already in the  rst step, in the construction of the algebra A. In simple examples, such as the free Maxwell  elds discussed above, the phase space is linear and the construction of A is straightforward. However, in general, the phase space is a genuine manifold, i.e., it does not admit a global chart. In the classical theory, then, it is not possible to specify a complete set of globally de ned con guration and momentum variables unless they are overcomplete. We can associate operators with all these variables. However, then we have to face the overcompleteness squarely in the quantum theory. (This situation arises, for example, in lattice gauge theories, where the Wilson loop variables are overcomplete.) In the original Dirac program, this issue was not addressed. These {and related{ issues were considered by Isham in [5], where he developed a group-theoretic approach to quantization to resolve these di culties. In this paper, we will focus on another approach, based on algebraic methods. [6]. These methods are more general in the sense that, if an appropriate \canonical group" on the classical phase space can be found to complete the Isham program for a given system, key steps of the algebraic program would be automatically completed. On the other hand, there also exist other methods to complete the program. Being more general, however, the algebraic program is correspondingly less speci c: While the group theoretic methods are \tight" in the sense that once the appropriate group is found, very little new input is needed, as we will see in section 2, the algebraic program needs inputs at several stages. In the algebraic approach, the problem of  nding the inner product was addressed through the following prescription: roughly, it states that the inner product should be such that a complete set of real classical observables should be represented on Vphy by self-adjoint operators. It is now known [7] that such an inner product, if it exists, is unique (modulo a multiplicative, overall constant). The prescription seems rather trivial at  rst sight. However, it is both powerful and {in some respects{ subtle. In the case of 3-dimensional general relativity, for example, although there are again no symmetries [4] (and, for a general spatial topology, no \deparametrization" is available), this principle does select the physical inner-product uniquely. The subtleties can be seen in the proof of uniqueness [7], as well as in the occasional occurrence of unforeseen superselected sectors, examples of which are discussed later in this paper. The second issue, that of overcompleteness, was addressed by providing a detailed prescription for the construction of the algebra A; the new inputs required to pass from the classical to the quantum theory were isolated and a prescription was given to handle the possible overcompleteness. Note that these two issues arise also in the reduced phase space method: one again needs a guideline to select the inner product on the space of physical quantum states, and, since the reduced phase spaces are typically genuine manifolds without a natural cotangent bundle structure, one must deal with overcompleteness. Therefore, the algebraic program developed in [6] is relevant to the reduced phase space approach as well. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate various aspects of the program through  ve examples. The examples are motivated primarily by the problem of quantum general relativity and each of them mimics one or more \peculiarities" of general relativity. However, for the main discussion, no prior knowledge of general relativity is required. In section 2, we summarize the algebraic program of [6] on which the rest of the 3 paper is based, with special attention to the new ingredients. In section 3, we consider an unconstrained system to illustrate how the prescription for  nding the inner product can enable one to quantize systems with \hybrid" canonical variables, in which the con guration variable, for example, may be complex but its conjugate momentum, real. (Such variables arise in 4-dimensional general relativity and simplify the structure of Einstein’s equations considerably). In sections 4-6, we discuss four constrained systems. In each case, we carry out the quantization program in detail to illustrate its various subtle aspects. The example discussed in section 5 is especially interesting as it illustrates how the program can be used to resolve ambiguities that may have important physical consequences. In all these cases, we are motivated primarily by issues in mathematical physics. Therefore, issues of detailed physical interpretation and those associated with the measurement theory will be left untouched. The program of [6] was distilled and re ned from a number of examples. Because of this and because we have tried to make our discussion here self-contained, there is some inevitable overlap between [6] and the material covered in this paper. The previous discussion was, however, incomplete in certain respects and also contained a minor error. We have taken this opportunity to rectify the situation. 2 Quantization Program In this section we will outline the extension of the Dirac quantization procedure for constrained systems {which constitutes the basis for the rest of the paper{ and discuss in some detail its key features. The extension is based on the algebraic approach to quantum mechanics [8, 9]. 2.1 The main steps Consider a classical system for which the phase space  is a real symplectic manifold (which will be  nite dimensional in all examples discussed in the paper). We are par- ticularly interested in systems which are subject to  rst class constraints. To quantize such a system, we proceed in the following steps: 1. Select a subspace S of the vector space of all smooth, complex-valued functions on  subject to the following conditions: (a) S should be large enough so that any su ciently regular function on the phase space can be obtained as (possibly a suitable limit of) a sum of products of elements F(i) in S. Technically, S is (locally) complete if and only if the gradients of the functions F in S span the cotangent space of  at each point. The unit function \1" should also be included in S. (b) S should be closed under Poisson brackets, i.e. for all functions F;G in S, their Poisson bracketfF;Gg should also be an element of S. (c) Finally,S should be closed under complex conjugation, i.e. for all F inS, the complex conjugate  F should be a function inS. 4 Each function in S is to be regarded as an elementary classical variable which is to have an unambiguous quantum analog [9]. The  rst requirement on S ensures that the space of the resulting elementary quantum operators is \large enough," the second enables us to de ne commutators between these operators unambiguously while the third will lead us to the ?-relations between these operators. It is often the case that in order to satisfy the completeness requirement, one is forced (say by the non-trivial topology of the phase space) to include more functions in the set S than the dimension of the phase space. In this case, there are algebraic relations between them. 2. Associate with each element F in S an abstract operator ^F. Construct the free algebra generated by these elementary quantum operators. Impose on it the canon- ical commutation relations, [ ^F; ^G] = i h dfF;Gg, and, if necessary, also the (anti- commutation) relations which capture the algebraic identities satis ed by the ele- mentary classical variables. (The details are discussed in section 2.2.) Denote the resulting algebra by A. 3. On this algebra, introduce an involution operation2, denoted by ?, by requiring that if two elementary classical variables F and G are related by  F = G (where  F denotes the complex conjugate of F), then ^F? = ^G in A. Denote the resulting ?-algebra byA(?). As can be seen from its de nition, the ?-relation onA(?) re ects the reality relation between the elementary variables. 4. Construct a linear representation of the abstract algebra A via linear operators on some complex vector space V. (Because of the structure of A the canonical commutation relations and the anticommutation relations (if any) should, in par- ticular, be satis ed on V_) Note that for now the ?-relations on A(?) are to be ignored. 5. Obtain explicit operators ^C on V, representing the quantum constraints. In gen- eral, a choice of factor ordering (and, in the case of systems with an in nite number of degrees of freedom, also of regularization) has to be made at this stage. Physical states lie in the kernelVphy of these operators. That is,j iis a physical state only if it is a solution to the quantum constraint equation: ^Cj i= 0: (2.1) 6. Extract the physical subalgebra, Aphy, of operators that leaveVphy invariant. Not all operators inAare of this type. An operator ^A inA will leaveVphy invariant if and only if ^A commutes weakly with the constraints, i.e. [ ^A; ^CI] = X J ^fJI ^CJ: (2.2) 2An involution operation on A is a map ? from A to itself satisfying the following three conditions for all A and B in A: i) (A +  B)? = A? +   B?, where  is any complex number and   its complex conjugate; ii)(AB)? = B?A?; and, iii) (A?)? = A. 5

Mathematically,supersymmetrytransformationsfallin thecategoryofgradedLiegroups,with commuting and anticommuting parameters [12,37]. In addition to the generators of Lorentz transformations and translations in a D-dimensional space}time, the supersymmetry algebra containsoneormorespinorsupercharges(`simpleaor`N-extendedasupersymmetry).Asaconse- quenceoftheparticularalgebraicstructure,Wigner'sanalysisofunitaryrepresentations[161]can begeneralizedtothesupersymmetriccase[136,116,76,66],givingrisetothenotionofsupermultip- lets which combine bosons and fermions. Althoughtheoreticallyveryappealing,noexplicitsignofsuchaBose}Fermisymmetryhasbeen observed experimentally. This does not prevent experimental physicists to put supersymmetric versions of the standard model [119,103] to the test [127,128]. So far they turn out to be compatible with data. On a more fundamental level, in the context of recent developments in string/brane theory [139,141,95,129], supergravity in 11 dimensions [116,40] seems to play an important role. Such astring,ormembranetheoryisexpectedtomanifestitselfinafour-dimensionalpointparticlelimit as some locally supersymmetric e!ective theory. The basic structure of a generic D"4, N"1e!ective theory is provided by supergravity [50,75] coupled to various lower spin multiplets.

This report provides a presentation of the geometric superspace approach. The notion of superspace is based on the concept of super"elds [134,71,138]: space}time is promoted to superspace in adding anticommuting parameters and super"elds are functions of space}time coordinates and the anticommutingcoordinates. Supersymmetry transformations are realized as di!erential operations involving spinor derivatives. Implementingthemachineryofdi!erentialgeometry,likedi!erentialforms,exteriorderivatives, interior product, etc., on superspace gives rise to superspace geometry. In this framework super- symmetry and general coordinate transformations are described in a uni"ed way as certain di!eomorphisms.Boththegravitonanditssuperpartner,thegravitino,areidenti"edin theframe di!erential form of superspace. The superspace formulation of supergravity [100,157}159,101,163] and supersymmetric gauge theory[150,151]isbynowstandardtextbookknowledge[80,153].Acharacteristicfeatureofthis formulation is that the structure group in superspace is represented by the vector and spinor representations of the Lorentz group. This superspace geometry may be modi"ed by adding a chiral ;(1) to the structure group transformations,accompaniedby the correspondinggauge potential di!erential form. Associated withthisAbeliangaugegroupisanunconstrainedpre-potentialsuper"eld.Byitself,thisstructure is called ;(1) superspace [105], it allows to obtain the known supergravity multiplets mentioned above: minimal, new minimal and non-minimal, upon applying suitable restrictions [115]. The superspace description of the supergravity}matter coupling is obtained from ;(1) super- space as well: in this case the chiral;(1) is replaced by super"eld KaKhler transformations. At the same time the unconstrained pre-potential is identi"ed with the super"eld KaKhler potential [21,18,98,99]. In this formulation, called Ka( hler superspace geometry, or ; p41 (1) superspace ge- ometry, the KaKhler phase transformations are implemented abinitio at a geometric level, the KaKhlerweightsofallthesuper-andcomponent"eldsaregivenintrinsicallyandnorescalingsare needed in the construction of the supersymmetric action. The KaKhler superspace formulation is related to the KaKhler}Weyl formalism [152] in a straightforward way [18]. The construction of the general supergravity/matter/Yang}Mills system using the KaKhler superspace formulation is the central issue of this report.

Fisica SOLUTION TO THE EINSTEIN AND POINCARÉ PARADOX OF SUPERLUMINAL ADDITION OF VELOCITIES V. Baranauskas, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, 13083-970 Campinas, SP, Brazil Abstract A new set of space and time quantizied transformations is presented, and  for any quantization order it gives invariant transformations for which the light velocity is constant. It gives linear functions with real solutions even above the light velocity value. In the low velocity range it may be approximated to the Galilean transformations and for high order quantization it gives conformity to Lorentz transformations. Its direct application to the composition of high velocities theory showed new results compared to the addition theorem of Einstein and Poincaré (E-P).  When the relative velocities are in the same range of values a close fitness to the E-P’s theorem is demonstrated up to the c value. Above c a strong divergence from the E-P’s result will be showed. We concluded that these results give a new insight to the concept of advanced accelerators and to the solution of some astrophysics problems. 1  INTRODUCTION TO THE EINSTEIN- POINCARÉ PARADOX Starting from the proposal of the contraction of the space in the direction of the movement, presented by Lorentz to justify the constancy of the light velocity, Einstein[1]  and Poincaré[2]  (E-P), independently, deduced the well-known formula of addition of velocities: V uv uv c = + +1 2                               (1) where V is the composition velocity relative to a space and time system S,  of a velocity u measured relative to another system S',  when the system S' is moving uniformly relative to S with velocity v .  The light velocity is denoted by c. As a result of this kinematics the combination of velocities less than c always results in velocities less than c, or subluminal velocities. Also, this addition equation cannot be applied for the combination of relative velocities larger than c (superluminals) because according to the proposal of Lorentz the values of the space and time coordinates would be imaginary.   Even if this equation has its algebraic results extended for superluminal velocities, the sum can result in subluminal velocities or in the limit to the zero velocity. This example is illustrated in Fig.1 for the sum of two identical relative velocities. Therefore in the E-P model the velocity of the light is not just constant, it also plays the role of the maximum limit to the velocities. The objective of this work is, without violating the principle of the constancy of the light velocity, to demonstrate  that the  solution  proposed  by  E-P  is not unique. We introduced a generalized and finite solution which can be applied even for the composition of superluminal velocities.  If at least one of the relative velocities is superluminal (or luminal) the result will never be subluminal (see Fig.1).  In the subluminal range the numeric results can coincide with the results of the E-P equation. Figure 1:  Comparison of the Galilean, E-P, and of this work for the addition of identical velocities (u = v). 2  BEYOND THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS In this section we will demonstrate that the Lorentz transformations are not the only transformations in which the the light velocity can be maintained constant.  Starting from there we will show why the Lorentz transformations cannot be applied to superluminal velocities. Finally, we 835 propose a more appropriate group of transformations, applicable for any velocity. 2.1  Demonstration that an infinite number of transformation functions exist in which the light velocity is constant. Let the origins of S and S' be coincident at tt=='0, and suppose that  S' is moving with velocity v relative to S along the x  direction.  The coordinate x' of  S' can be related to coordinate x  of S system by a general transformation such as xx xvt??? ?' = ?? 12                    (2) where ? 1  and ? 2   are functions to be determined. Owing to the symmetry with respect to the direction of movement,  the inverse transformation must also exist: xx xvt''' ??? + = ?? 12                   (3) Then, by simple algebraic manipulation of eqn. (2) and eqn. (3) it can be shown that the time is also transformed according to: () tt t x v ??? + ? ' = ? ? ? 1 1 2 2 1              (4) Due to the hypothesis of the constancy of the light velocity  the position of a single wave front of light emitted at the origin of both systems when the spaces S and S' are coincident, will be described by the corresponding equations, () xct 2 2 =                             (5) and () ( )xct'' 22 =                            (6) Introducing eqns (2)  and  (3) into eqns (5) and (6), we have, ?? 1 2 2 22 =+ v c                         (7) Therefore any functions ? 1  and ? 2  that obey the above relationship produce space and time transformations in which the velocity of the light is constant, as we wanted to demonstrate.  This relationship will be called here as the  hidden  equation. 2.2   Why the Lorentz transformation cannot be applied for superluminal velocities. In the E-P theory there is no distinction among ? 1  and ? 2 functions.  With this condition, the application of the hidden equation gives the Lorentz function (? L ). ??? L v c ===? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 12 2 2 12 1 /                  (8) In Fig.2 we have an illustration of the hyperbolaes given by the hidden equation. The Lorentz solutions are determined by the crossing points of these hyperbolaes with the straight line ?? 12 =.    The asymptotes of the hyperbolaes are given by: ?? 12 = v c                                 (9) As the straight line of Fig.2  is also the asymptote of the hyperbola for the value of vc=,  the Lorentz solution for vc= is an Euclidian absurd since no hyperbola meets its asymptote. For assuming this, the Lorentz transformations give only space-time continuum solutions.   It is also evident that real Lorentz solutions for vc? don't exist. Figure 2: Geometric representation of the hidden equation in the Lorentz solution.  2.3  Proposal of a new transformation. Starting from the hidden equation we can define pairs of finite functions given by   () () ?? 1 2 2 1 kk v c =+                      (10) and ?? 2 1 1 kk? =                          (11) where k = 12, , ...  is the order number of the functions. The simplest group is obtained being taken ? 2 1 1= . Applying this result in eqns. (3) and  (4) gives xx x ct BB ??? ? ?' = ?? 2 1                  (12) and tt t x c BB ??? ? ?' = ?? 2 1                 (13) with ? B n k n k v c v c v c = ? ? ? ? ? ? = ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?= + ? 0 2 21 2 1 1 ()                (14) 836 These transformations maintain the principle of the constancy of the light velocity for any value of the order k, and are simple transformations. One can easily observe from eqn. (14) that for subluminal velocities the factor ? B  approaches the Lorentz factor ? L .   However, ? B can be applied for any velocity ?? < < +?v .  3  GENERAL SOLUTION TO THE COMPOSITION OF VELOCITIES Starting from the eqns. (12) and  (13)  we can derive the corresponding infinitezimal equations for the transformations of the space and of the time:   ???xxct BB ' ?? = ?? 2 1                  (15) ?? ? tt x c BB  ?? = ?? 2 1                  (16) and obtain the composition velocity of v and u by V x t u u c BB BB =  +? +? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  =  c c ?? ?? 2 2 1 1                 (17)  This equation will be denoted here as the general composition for velocities.  As the proposed space and time transformation doesn't limit the values of v or u, the general equation of composition of velocities is unrestricted, that is, it can be applied for the sum of subluminals or superluminals velocities, respectively. The three-dimensional plot of  V in function of u and v is presented in Fig. 3.  We can verify the existence of superluminal solutions and also a break of the symmetry between u and v.   Thus, it is possible to differentiate the movement of the system S' relative to S  (velocity v) from the movement of the points relative to S' (velocity u).      Figure 3: Three-dimensional plot of the  composed velocity V  (axis z),  following the present work.    The resulting composition velocity of an almost stationary S' system ( v ? 0) will be Vu?, that can be subluminal or superluminal.  If the velocity of the system S' goes to luminal or superluminal values, the composition velocity will always be luminal, that is Vc=, independently of the value of u. In the subluminal range, the present results are close to the E-P theory and the symmetry of velocities exists.  4  ASTROPHYSICS OBSERVATIONS  Through the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) and of the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) 15 Gamma-Ray Sources (GRS) were identified and confirmed with apparent superluminal movements[3]. Its properties include the superluminal movement of its radiation center or of the halo of its expelled jets. They also possess evident asymmetry in its radiation structure.   In spite of the orthodox proposals of interpretation, the physical results are still not satisfactory. Sources as the Gamma-Ray blazar NRAO 530 presents jets with velocities above 26c[3].   The theory presented in this work justifies the existence of the superluminal movement of these sources without entering in conflict with the Michelson-Morley results. Furthemore, it justifies the superluminal asymmetry.  5  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the existence of simple space and time transformations that take into account the constancy of the light velocity and can be applied to superluminal velocities. The proposed transformations, for its own solution, don't need the hypothesis of a continuous space-time and therefore don't contradict the quantum theory. The function  ? B  shows that high order effects in relation to velocity should be present in the particle accelerators. These effects can be useful for advanced concepts of accelerators. The transformations applied to the E-P paradox of the composition of velocities shown that superluminal velocities are possible, giving an explanation to the cosmological superluminal velocities presented by the space Gama-Ray sources.  6  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The author thanks the Brazilian Foundations FAPESP and CNPq for financial support.

In popular cosmological models, the FFrst sources of light began to form at a redshift z=30 and reionized most of the hydrogen in the universe by z=7. Current observations are at the threshold of probing the hydrogen reionization epoch.

Preface: the frontier of small-scale structure The detection of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies (Bennett et al., 1996; de Bernardis et al., 2000; Hanany et al., 2000) conFFrmed the notion that the present large-scale structure in the universe originated from small-amplitude density CRuctuations at early times. in- ferred density CRuctuations Due to the naturalinstability of gravity, regions that were denser than average collapsed and formed bound objects, FFrst on small spatial scales and later on larger and larger scales. The present-day abundance of bound objects, such as galaxies and X-ray clusters, can be explained based on an appropriate extrapolation of the detected anisotropies to smaller scales. Existing observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (e.g., Steidelet al., 1996; Madau et al., 1996; Chen et al., 1999; Clements et al., 1999) and ground-based telescopes (Lowenthal et al., 1997; Dey et al., 1998; Hu et al., 1998, 1999; Spinrad et al., 1998; Steidel et al., 1999), have constrained the evolution of galaxies and their stellar content at z66. How- ever, in the bottom-up hierarchy of the popular cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies, galaxies were assembled out of building blocks of smaller mass. The elementary building blocks, i.e., the FFrst gaseous objects to form, acquired a totalmass of order the Jeans mass ( ?10 4 M circledot ), below which gas pressure opposed gravity and prevented collapse (Couchman and Rees, 1986; Haiman and Loeb, 1997; Ostriker and Gnedin, 1996). In variants of the standard CDM model, these basic building blocks FFrst formed at z ? 15–30. An important qualitative outcome of the microwave anisotropy data is the conFFrmation that the universe started out simple. It was by and large homogeneous and isotropic with small CRuc- tuations that can be described by linear perturbation analysis. The current universe is clumsy and complicated. Hence, the arrow of time in cosmic history also describes the progression from simplicity to complexity (see Fig. 1). While the conditions in the early universe can be summarized on a single sheet of paper, the mere description of the physical and biological structures found in the present-day universe cannot be captured by thousands of books in our libraries. The formation of the FFrst bound objects marks the central milestone in the transition from simplicity to complexity. Pedagogically, it would seem only natural to attempt to under- stand this epoch before we try to explain the present-day universe. Historically, however, most of the astronomical literature focused on the local universe and has only been shifting recently to the early universe. This violation of the pedagogical rule was forced upon us by the limited state of our technology; observation of earlier cosmic times requires detection of distant sources, which is feasible only with large telescopes and highly-sensitive instrumentation. For these reasons, advances in technology are likely to make the high redshift universe an important frontier of cosmology over the coming decade. This eVTort will involve large (30 m) ground-based telescopes and will culminate in the launch of the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, called Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). Fig. 2 shows an artist’s illustration of this telescope which is currently planned for launch in 2009. NGST will image the FFrst sources of light that formed in the universe. With its exceptional sub-nJy (1 nJy = 10 ?32 erg cm ?2 s ?1 Hz ?1 ) sensitivity in the 1–3:5SYNm infrared regime, NGST is ideally suited for probing optical-UV emission from sources at redshifts ¿10, just when popular cold dark matter models for structure formation predict the FFrst baryonic objects to have collapsed. The study of the formation of the FFrst generation of sources at early cosmic times (high redshifts) holds the key to constraining the power-spectrum of density CRuctuations on small R. Barkana, A.

Previous research in cosmology has been dominated by studies of large-scale structure (LSS); future studies are likely to focus on small-scale structure (SSS). The FFrst sources are a direct consequence of the growth of linear density CRuctuations. As such, they emerge from a well-deFFned set of initial conditions and the physics of their formation can be followed precisely by computer simulation.

Cosmological configuration space is decomposed into two sectors that give qualitatively different contributions to the radiation currents in effective equations. The field- theoretical sector of inhomogeneous modes is treated by the method of Euclidean effective action, while the quantum mechanical sector of the spatially homogeneous inflaton is handled by the technique of manifest quantum reduction to gauge invariant cosmological perturbations. We apply this framework in the model with a big negative non-minimal coupling, which incorporates a recently proposed low energy (GUT scale) mechanism of the quantum origin of the inflationary Universe and study the effects of the quantum inflaton mode. ? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These initial conditions, encoded in the no-boundary [2–4] and tunneling [5] quantum states, can be a source of the inflationary scenario at the low (typically GUT) energy scale [6,7], compatible with the observational status of inflation theory. In [6,7] the initial conditions were found as a sharp peak in the probability distribution of the quantum scalar field whose expectation value simulates the effective Hubble constant and drives inflation. The parameters of this peak — its location and quantum width — are suppressed relative to the Planckian values by a small factor coinciding with the magnitude of the CMBR anisotropy, Delta1T/T ? 10 ?5 , according to normalization on COBE [8,9]. In [10,11] these results were extended to the open model based on the Hawking–Turok instanton [12]. E-mail address: barvin@td.lpi.ru (A.O.

Nesterov / Nuclear Physics B 608 (2001) 333–374 Although, a priori these features make this model attractive, serious objections usually arise regarding the present day status of initial conditions in cosmology. Their issue in inflation theory is a subject of strong debate in current literature [13] and numerous meetings on structure formation of the Universe. The possibility of quantum cosmological imprint on the observational data was called in question from the viewpoint of the self- reproducing inflation scenario [14,15], eternal inflation [13] and anthropic principle [16]. These objections rely on special conditions guaranteeing self-reproduction and eternal inflation. However, in the model of [1,6,7] these conditions are not satisfied at the probability peak of the distribution function. The energy scale at this peak turns out to be far below the threshold beyond which eternal inflation begins (see Section 2 below). Thus this model represents a sound example of the low-energy phenomenon of the quantum birth of the Universe deserving further studies. The dynamical consequences of the inflaton probability peak were first studied at the level of classical equations [6,7]. Then they were reexamined at the level of effective equations for quantum expectation values of fields [1]. Note that in cosmology it is often considered that the description in terms of the mean field and the set of higher-order correlation functions is not exhaustive. In contrast with conventional quantum field theory, interpretation of quantum cosmology is marred by the conceptual issues of the physical observer being the part of a quantum system. In particular, it is often assumed that the observational process leads to the reduction of the cosmological state to those values of fields which are far from their quantum expectations. This complicated and, in our opinion, not yet completely understood phenomenon is usually modelled in terms of stochastic random process serving, in particular, as a basis for eternal inflation and self-reproduction. Thus, eternal inflation starting from members of quantum ensemble remote from the probability peak can start dominating in the full stochastic ensemble which replaces the quantum one. This phenomenon goes beyond the scope of this paper, because we will be interested in the effective equations of motion for a particular, most probable, member of this ensemble. This can be justified by the fact that for a very sharp probability peak (located far away from the self-reproduction domain) stochasticity is unlikely to contribute essentially to effective equations in question. 1 The effective equations analyses of [1] was not complete — their quantum contribution included all modes except the main spatially homogeneous mode related to quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field. This is the main spatially global degree of freedom 1 Note that effective equations is a well defined concept when they are supplied with initial conditions given by expectation values in the initial quantum state. These equations can be derived from the demand that their solution is an evolving expectation value of the quantum Heisenberg operator (see Section 3 below). From this it unambiguously follows that for small quantum effects effective equations coincide with classical ones up to loop corrections. Similarly, the history evolving from the outskirts of the initial quantum distribution demands a precise definition. A priori ascribing to it classical equations of motion might lead to inconsistencies. Indeed, it is natural to assume that this history is again the time evolving expectation value, but now — with respect to the new quantum state which arose as a result of the wave function reduction to the domain distant from the probability maximum. Its equation of motion will be semiclassical only when this new state is semiclassical itself. As we see, this in turn implies strong assumptions about the nature of wave function collapse underlying the stochastic description and eternal inflation. A.O. Barvinsky, D.V. Nesterov / Nuclear Physics B 608 (2001) 333–374 335 in cosmology. It is responsible for the quantum fluctuations of the homogeneous (minisuperspace) background on top of which all the other inhomogeneous modes dynamically evolve. As was understood in [1], the contribution of this mode requires the calculational technique different from the technique for inhomogeneous ones. The latter is strongly facilitated by the method of Euclidean effective action which is based on specific properties of their quantum state on the quasi-de Sitter background — Euclidean de Sitter invariant vacuum [17]. On the contrary, the quantum state of the inflaton is irrelevant to this vacuum and its contribution cannot be obtained by the analytic continuation from the Euclidean effective action. Rather, this state is determined by the peak of the inflaton probability distribution and can be approximated by the gaussian packet. Direct quantum averaging with respect to this packet is required for obtaining the contribution of the inflaton mode to effective equations. This step, however, should be preceded by several other calculational steps involving the Hamiltonian reduction to the physical sector, setting the quantum Cauchy problem in the minisuperspace sector of the system, etc. Thus, the goal of the present paper is to pose the quantum Cauchy problem in cosmology for the no-boundary and tunneling quantum states, derive the one-loop contribution of the homogeneous mode to effective equations and analyze its influence on the inflationary dynamics. One of particular questions, to be clarified in this work, is to what an extent this contribution can change the conclusions of our previous papers [1,7]. In the spatially closed model with the no-boundary and tunneling cosmological states these conclusions were pretty stringent. The no-boundary quantum state can give rise only to the eternally long inflation, while the finite inflation stage with the conventional exit to the matter-dominated Universe exists only for the tunneling state. 2 These conclusions give an undoubtful preference to the tunneling state from the viewpoint of the observational cosmology, but, at the fundamental level, the tunneling state has an intrinsic problem if one goes beyond the tree-level approximation. 3 So, there is a hope that the inclusion of quantum fluctuations in the minisuperspace sector can render the no-boundary state viable from the viewpoint of the inflationary cosmology. Unfortunately, as we shall see, this hope does not realize — the effect of this mode turns out to be too small. This result, however, is model dependent, and the application of the general framework of this paper might lead to other conclusions in alternative models with well-defined quantum states of the inflaton. It should be emphasized, that despite intensive studies on the inflationary dynamics, quantum nature of the homogeneous inflaton mode has not yet been completely under- 2 In open cosmology based on the Hawking–Turok instanton [12] the initial conditions for finite inflation stage can be realized for the no-boundary state [10,11], but the models of [11,12] with all their merits and disadvantages go beyond the scope of this paper. 3 Point is that the classical Euclidean action enters the exponential of the tunneling wavefunction with the “wrong” sign — opposite to that of the loop corrections [18]. This mismatch invalidates the conventional renormalization procedure of absorbing the ultraviolet divergences into the redefinition of classical coupling constants [19]. This inconsistency does not break the results of [1,6,7] (heavily relying on loop effects) for accidental reasons — renormalization ambiguous part of the distribution function in the slow roll approximation factors out as an inert overall normalization. However, it shows up beyond this approximation and, thus, persists at the fundamental level. 336 A.O. Barvinsky, D.V. Nesterov / Nuclear Physics B 608 (2001) 333–374 stood. This mode is peculiar because of its ghost nature — its kinetic term enters the action with the wrong sign. This fact was emphasized in [20], but its cosmological consequences have not yet properly been examined. There is a viewpoint that this mode should at all be excluded from the quantum perturbations spectrum on the physical grounds that it is always beyond the horizon and not directly observable [21]. This approach can hardly be justified, because this mode is in some sense the most fundamental one, for it determines the homogeneous background on top of which all observable perturbations are unraveling. The energy of this quantum mechanical mode in view of its ghost nature is not positive definite, and it leads to peculiar back reaction phenomena which we are going to discuss here. Despite their actual small magnitude in our model, in other cases they might essen- tially contribute to the cosmological evolution. As we shall see, quantum fluctuations of the homogeneous inflaton have the equation of state p +? = 0 and, thus, it can even be a candidate for the present day cosmological constant, instead of quintessence. This is one more motivation for our studies. The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we briefly recapitulate the results of [6,7,18] for the model with a big negative nonminimal coupling of the inflaton, ??R? 2 /2, ?? =|?|greatermuch1, having a quasi-quartic potential V(?)= ?? 4 /4 + ···.We formulate the mechanism of one-loop radiative corrections due to which the inflaton distribution acquires a sharp peak. This peak gives rise to initial conditions for inflation and quantum fluctuations contributing to the radiation currents — quantum terms in the effective equations. In Section 3 we reveal the general structure of these currents and their gauge invariance properties. In particular, their decomposition into the contributions of two sectors is presented: the quantum mechanical sector of the homogeneous inflaton and the field-theoretical sector of inhomogeneous modes. The Euclidean effective action method is formulated for the calculation of the latter, while the former is supposed to be obtained by direct quantum averaging with respect to the peak-like wavefunction of the inflaton. In Section 4 we go over to the generic model with minimally coupled inflaton. For this model we pose the Cauchy problem for the classical solution — the tree-level approximation for expectation values. We perform quantum reduction of the wavefunction from minisuperspace (of the scale factor and inflaton) to the physical subspace, the latter playing the role of the Cauchy surface in minisuperspace at which quantum initial conditions are posed. For the no-boundary and tunneling wavefunctions this subspace is chosen as a domain corresponding to the nucleation of the Lorentzian quasi-de Sitter spacetime from the Euclidean one. In Section 5 a similar quantum Cauchy problem is posed for cosmological perturbations. Their physical reduction is briefly presented along the lines of [20]. Perturbations of minisuperspace variables — scale factor, lapse and inflaton — are expressed in the Newton gauge in terms of the invariant physical variables of [20]. The latter, in their turn, are found as operators in the representation of the physical wavefunction on the Cauchy surface of the above type. In Section 6 we get back to the nonminimal model of Section 2 and discuss its reparametrization to the Einstein frame which allows one to transform its quantum Cauchy problem to that of the minimal model of Sections 4 and 5. We also describe here the calculation of radiation currents and derive the expression for the rolling force in the effective inflaton equation. Sections 7 and 8 present the resulting effects A.O. Barvinsky, D.V. Nesterov / Nuclear Physics B 608 (2001) 333–374 337 respectively at the beginning of inflation and at late steady inflationary stage. Concluding section contains a brief summary of results and prospective implications of its technique. 2. Quantum origin of the Universe as a low-energy phenomenon The starting point of our considerations is the assumption that quantum cosmology can give initial conditions for inflation, which in their turn determine main cosmological para- meters of the observable Universe, including the density parameter ?. The requirement of ?>1 in closed cosmology gives the bound on the e-folding number N — the logarith- mic expansion coefficient for the scale factor a during the inflation stage with a Hubble constant H =?a/a, (2.1)N = t F integraldisplay 0 dtH (witht = 0andt F denoting the beginning and the end of inflation epoch). This bound reads N greaterorequalslant60 [12]. On the other hand, the value of N is directly related to the initial conditions for inflation — initial value of the inflaton, ? I , (2.2)N similarequal? ? I integraldisplay 0 d? H(?) ?? . In the chaotic inflation model the effective Hubble constant H = H(?)is generated by the inflaton and, therefore, all the parameters of the inflationary epoch can be found as functions of ? I . This initial condition belongs to the quantum domain, i.e., it is subject to the quantum distribution following from the cosmological wavefunction. If this distribution has a sharp probability peak at certain ? =? I , then this value serves as the initial condition for inflation. There are two known quantum states that lead in the semiclassical regime to the closed inflationary Universe — the no-boundary [2–4] and tunneling [5] wavefunctions. They both describe quantum nucleation of the Lorentzian quasi-de Sitter spacetime from the Euclidean (positive signature) hemisphere — the gravitational instanton responsible for the classically forbidden state of the gravitational field.

Karlheinz Baumgartl: Astronomie in der Cheopspyramide (Seite 1 von 7) Astronomie in der Cheopspyramide © Karlheinz Baumgartl; veröffentlicht in EFODON-SYNESIS Nr. 9/1995 Meine Reise nach Ägypten erfolgte, um - nach dem Studium der Literatur - eigene Eindrücke zu gewinnen und vor allem die astronomischen Bezüge in den Pyramiden nachzuvollziehen. Drei Tage verbrachten wir in Giza bei den Pyramiden. Außerdem besuchten wir das Ägyptische Museum in Kairo, die Stadtteile Memphis, Heliopolis, die Pyramiden von Sakkara und die Oase El-Fajum, um auch das Hinterland etwas kennenzulernen. Wer sich mit dem alten Ägypten befasst, fragt sich, warum es - außer bei Herodot - keine Berichte gibt über die Pyramiden und ihre Erbauer. Seit etwa 2500 Jahren ist Ägypten fremdbestimmt. Schon der Name Ägypten ist griechisch (aigyptos) und bedeutet "Schwarze Erde". Die Einheimischen nennen ihr Land Kêmi, das schwarze Land. Gemeint ist der fruchtbare Boden, den der Nil (griech. neilos) geschaffen hat. Es fällt schwer, ursprüngliche Namen zu finden. So erscheinen uns die wenigen, unveränderten Namen aus Altägypten selber fremd, wie beispielsweise On für das damalige geistige Zentrum Heliopolis (griech. Sonnenstadt). "Die Ägypter haben zweimal ihren Glauben gewechselt: von der altägyptischen Religion traten sie als erstes Volk der Erde in ihrer Gesamtheit zum Christentum über, nach der Unterwerfung durch die Araber (640 n.Chr.), die auch die bis dahin noch lebende altägyptische Sprache völlig verdrängten, wurde der weitaus größte Teil der Bewohner Mohammedaner" (NACK, Ägypten). Die politischen Einwirkungen waren nicht minder gestaltend. Alexander der Große zerstörte im 4. vorchristlichen Jahrhundert Heliopolis, die damals bedeutendste Universität der Welt. Dort wirkten zeitweise 13.000 gelehrte Priester, u.a. auch Pythagoras. Mit der Zerstörung von Heliopolis wollte Alexander die geistigen und politischen Grundlagen des alten Reiches ein- für allemal beseitigen, um das hellenistische Weltreich zu verwirklichen. Als dann das römische Weltreich entstehen sollte, ließ Caesar die große Bibliothek von Alexandria in Flammen aufgehen. Und im Jahre 389 waren es die Christen unter Kaiser Theodosius, die wieder Feuer an die Bibliothek legten und alles vernichteten, was ihrem Anspruch auf Alleinseligmachung im Wege stand. Nach der Christianisierung galt alles Wissenschaftliche als heidnisch und somit als sündhaft. Den christianisierten Ägyptern war der Zugang zu den Pyramiden verboten. Später, im 13. Jahrhundert, begannen die islamischen Araber die Pyramiden zu zerstören, indem sie die äußere Kalksteinverblendung abbrachen und die Steine zum Bau ihrer Moscheen, Häuser und Brücken verwendeten. In unserem Jahrhundert wurden dann dem Staudamm von Assuan, Symbol des dortigen Fortschritts, viele Kultstätten geopfert. Zwar wird die alte Kultur vermarktet, aber ein echtes Interesse an ihr besteht nicht. An ihrer Erforschung war das arabisch-islamische Ägypten so gut wie nicht beteiligt. Wen wundert es bei dieser Sachlage, dass es über die Pyramiden keine Aufzeichnungen gibt? Die Spuren der frühen Hochkultur sind über viele Jahrhunderte unter verschiedenen Einwirkungen gründlich beseitigt worden. Galilei soll einmal gesagt haben: "Ich glaube, dass es in der Welt keinen größeren Hass gibt als den der Unwissenheit gegen das Wissen." An dem Schicksal der Pyramiden kann man Menschheitsgeschichte studieren. Man erkennt, was die Menschen früher wussten, wie das Wissen allmählich verloren ging und wie unwissend gewordene Menschen handelten bezüglich der alten Kultur. Der Zustand der Kultstätten, der Grad ihrer Zerstörung, die allgemeine Verwahrlosung ist ein Abbild neuzeitlicher Gesinnung. "Du gleichst dem Geist, den Du begreifst" (Goethe) Fremd ist den meisten Menschen heute die frühe Kultur. Der Historiker Eppel schreibt in seinem Buch über Ägypten, ihnen (den Wissenschaftlern) sei "die früheste Phase zutiefst verborgen." Barocas schreibt, jene Zeit sei "etwas Unbegreifliches" und Wernick bekennt, man habe "nur kümmerliche © 1995 EFODON e.V. Karlheinz Baumgartl: Astronomie in der Cheopspyramide (Seite 2 von 7) Antworten". Aber alle bezeichnen die Pyramiden als Grabstätten und Denkmäler der Pharaonen zur Repräsentation ihrer Macht. Barocas meint, die Pyramiden seien "immer eine Grabstätte", und es sei richtiger, "nicht von Pyramiden zu sprechen, sondern von Grabanlagen". Ich sehe darin einen Widerspruch: wenn jemand selber bekennt, dass ihm die frühe Zeit unbegreiflich sei, dann verstehe ich nicht, wie man dann so schlüssig von Grabstätten sprechen kann, zumal die Mathematik in dem Baukörper der Pyramiden geradezu ins Gesicht springt. Und eine Beweispflicht für solche Behauptungen scheint es für diese Art von Wissenschaftlern nicht zu geben. Von den 320 Pharaonen wurden siebzig Gräber gefunden, aber keine Mumie in den Pyramiden. Und es gibt auch keinen altägyptischen Text, der die Bestattungsbräuche in Zusammenhang mit den Pyramiden beschreibt. Der Wissenschaftsjournalist Peter Tompkins schreibt in seinem Buch "Cheops": "Die allgemein verbreitete, autoritativ vertretene Annahme, dass die Pyramide nur ein Grabmal zur bleibenden Verherrlichung irgendeines ruhmsüchtigen Pharaos sei, hat sich als falsch erwiesen." Aber die Anhänger der Grabmal-Theorie beherrschen die Lehrstühle und dulden keine Kritik. Sie ignorieren die Beweispflicht und sie ignorieren den Stand der Pyramidenforschung. Mit der gleichen Voreingenommenheit wird auch die Religion der alten Ägypter gedeutet, indem man ihren Glauben so hinstellt, als hätten die Menschen damals nur für das Jenseits gelebt und gebaut. Die alten Ägypter aber waren ein Volk von Gärtnern und Bauern. Sie lebten in einer für uns schwer vorstellbaren Naturverbundenheit. Und diese Naturmenschen sollen nun nichts anderes im Sinn gehabt haben, als für sich oder andere gigantische Grabanlagen zu erdenken und zu errichten? Lebensverneinend aber ist die christliche Religion. Die Organisation der römisch-paulinischen Kirche hat doch über Jahrhunderte alle lebens- und zukunftsträchtigen Werte abgewertet und die Menschen systematisch abgelenkt auf ein Irgendwann und Irgendwo. Durch den Jenseitsglauben wurden die Menschen in unserem Kulturkreis entwurzelt. Durch diesen Glauben empfanden sie die Werte des Daseins nicht mehr als so bedeutend, da sie ja im Jenseits für alle Entbehrungen im Diesseits entlohnt werden sollten. Die Ideologie des Christentums hat dem Leben den Schwerpunkt genommen! Besteht nun nicht die Gefahr und hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass in die Deutung der ägyptischen Religion das eigene Vorstellen einfließt? Astronomie - die älteste Wissenschaft Durch Astronomie und Mathematik wird Wissenschaftlichkeit in die Geschichtsdarstellung gebracht. Erst durch Astronomen, Mathematiker und Landvermesser entstand eine Pyramidenforschung. Gerade die Astronomie bietet die ausgezeichnete Möglichkeit, ein Wissen aus früher Zeit exakt zu rekonstruieren. Zunächst versuchen wir Ägypten und Europa als einen zusammenhängenden Kulturraum zu verstehen. Stellen wir nun die Pyramiden in Zusammenhang zu Stonehenge in Südengland, dem bedeutendsten astronomischen Zentrum im alten Europa: beiden Stätten gemein ist der auffallend hohe Stand der Himmelskunde. Ich frage mich: was könnte mit der Cheopspyramide erforscht worden sein, was man in Nordeuropa nicht hat erforschen können? In Europa wurde vor rund 5.000 Jahren der perfekte Sonnen-Mond-Kalender geschaffen. Dafür waren sicher viele Jahrhunderte Himmelsbeobachtung nötig, wenn man den komplizierten Gang des Mondes bedenkt. Stonehenge ist der Höhepunkt und die Krönung einer langen, wissenschaftlichen Epoche, deren Anfänge wir nur ahnen können. In der langen Zeit der Himmelsbeobachtung ist es sicher aufgefallen, dass es neben der Bewegung von Sonne und Mond noch eine andere, wesentlich langsamere Veränderung am gestirnten Himmel gab. Durch eine langsame, kreisende Bewegung der Erdachse verschieben sich die Sternbilder und die Schnittpunkte von Ekliptik und Himmelsäquator. Man nennt diese Bewegung der Erdachse Präzession 1 . Ein solcher Kreislauf der Erdachse dauert rund 25.800 Jahre. Danach wandert der Frühlingspunkt deshalb alle rund 2.150 Jahre durch ein ganzes Sternbild des Tierkreises, des zwölfgeteilten Jahreskreises. Himmelskunde ist erst umfassend durch die © 1995 EFODON e.V. Karlheinz Baumgartl: Astronomie in der Cheopspyramide (Seite 3 von 7) Kenntnis der Präzession. Aber mit Stonehenge war dieses Phänomen nicht zu erforschen. Der Standort ist ungünstig. Je weiter man nach Norden kommt, umso weniger ist der Himmelsäquator einzusehen. Am Äquator der Erde ist die Präzession auch nicht erforschbar, weil der Himmelspol, der Polarstern, nicht zu sehen ist. So ist der günstigste Standort zur Erforschung der Präzession ein möglichst südlicher Bereich bei gleichzeitiger Sicht des Polarsternes. Das ist der 30. Grad nördlicher Breite, der Standort der Pyramiden, wo man 80% des Himmels überschauen kann, einschließlich dem Dreh- und Angelpunkt des ganzen Himmelsgewölbes. Es gilt als sicher, dass die alten Ägypter das Phänomen der Präzession erforscht hatten. Die Frage ist, wie sie zu diesem Wissen gekommen waren? Der Standort Sechzehn Kilometer westlich von Kairo auf einem Felsplateau stehen die drei großen Pyramiden: die des Cheops (ägyptisch Chufu), Chephren (Chefre) und Mykerinos (Menkewre). Benannt sind sie nach Pharaonen der 4. Dynastie. Daneben befinden sich noch zweimal drei kleine Pyramiden und der berühmte Sphinx. Der Fels, auf dem diese Bauwerke stehen, heißt arabisch Giza, zu deutsch Gizeh (es gibt weitere Schreibweisen). Man spricht hier vom »Gizeh-Komplex«. Westlich davon liegt die Libysche Wüste. Die größte Pyramide ist die Cheopspyramide. Sie steht auf einer Fläche von fünf Hektar. Man hat errechnet, dass sie aus 2.300.000 Steinblöcken von jeweils zwei Tonnen Gewicht besteht. Dabei erreicht sie die Höhe eines vierzigstöckigen Hochhauses. Die Pyramiden stehen im Scheitelpunkt des Nildeltas, ihr geografischer Standort ist fast genau der 30. Grad nördlicher Breite. Die Pyramiden waren einmal in einer Qualität gebaut worden, dass so mancher Pyramidenforscher ins Schwärmen geriet. Der Engländer Howard-Vyse schrieb 1840, dass "die Kunstfertigkeit, die sich in der Ausgestaltung der Königskammer, in der Herstellung der Terrasse sowie der Verkleidungssteine zeigt, in der ganzen Welt absolut unerreicht ist." Der Landvermesser Flinders Petrie zeigte durch seine Messungen auf, dass die Pyramide eine Präzisionsarbeit darstellt, wie sie auch von modernsten Feinmechanikern nicht übertroffen wird. Zum Teil grenzen die bautechnischen Leistungen ans Wunderbare. Uns interessieren besonders die astronomischen Gesichtspunkte in den Pyramiden. Ihre Seiten sind ausgerichtet auf die vier Himmelsrichtungen Nord-Süd und Ost-West, und zwar mit einer Exaktheit, dass Petrie schrieb, man könne "die geringfügigen Abweichungen mit einem Daumen zudecken". Bereits die Bestimmung der Himmelsrichtungen ist Astronomie. Man muss sich orientieren, wenn man den Gang der Gestirne erforschen will. Ebenso exakt - auf einen Zentimeter genau - ist die Waagerechte von 50.000 Quadratmetern der Cheopspyramide verwirklicht. Auch das ist eine Voraussetzung zur Himmelsbeobachtung. Im alten Ägypten war Sokar der Gott der Orientierung. Da die Vokale in den altägyptischen Worten lediglich ägyptologische Versuchungen sind, könnte man auch Sakar lesen, vielleicht enthalten in Sakkara, dem Ort, wo die älteste Pyramide (Stufenpyramide) steht 2 . Sakkara könnte also ein Ort der Orientierung gewesen sein, und dort stand eine Pyramide. Damit sind die Voraussetzungen zur Astronomie belegt. Eine weitergehende Justierung erfolgte durch die Ausrichtung des absteigenden Ganges, der in allen Pyramiden besteht, auf den Polarstern. Die Pyramiden sind also "genordet". Bei der Cheopspyramide ist dieser Gang fast 107 Meter lang und führt bis fünfzig Meter unter die Basis der Pyramide. Wie Petrie mit Erstaunen feststellte, weicht dieser Gang, der 110 Zentimeter breit und 120 Zentimeter hoch ist, in seiner ganzen Länge nur um 6,3 Millimeter von der Ideallinie ab. Die Neigung beträgt 26 o 17'. Damit nun der damalige Polarstern alpha draconis (im Sternbild des Drachens) auf dem 30. Breitengrad genau in diesen Gang schien, musste er die Neigung von 26°17' haben, denn beim Bau der Pyramide war dieser Stern um 3 o 43' vom wahren Himmelspol entfernt. Rechnerisch ergibt 30 o  minus 3 o 43' die Gangneigung von 26 o 17'. © 1995 EFODON e.V.

Damit wird das vermutete Alter der Pyramiden von etwa 4.900 Jahren bestätigt 3 . Wir waren am untersten Punkt dieses Ganges und sahen die Öffnung der Cheopspyramide in 107 Metern Entfernung als einen kleinen Schlitz. Das war beeindruckend! Der Zugang in die Pyramide erfolgt heute nicht durch diese kleine Öffnung, sondern durch den Stollen, den der Kalif Al-Mamun im Jahre 820 hat herausstemmen lassen, als man den zehn Steinschichten höher liegenden Geheimgang nicht finden konnte. Bedeutungsvoll ist die Art der Abzweigung des aufsteigenden Ganges, denn diese erfolgt genau in der Ideallinie des absteigenden Ganges und setzt die Neigung von 26 o 17' nach oben zur sogenannten Galerie und sogar durch die Galerie fort. Das kann nur astronomische Gründe haben, nämlich dass dieser nach oben führende Gang mit der Ausrichtung auf den Polarstern zu tun hat. Das war möglich, indem an der Abzweigung durch eine Spiegelung (eventuell durch Wasserspiegel) das Licht des Polarsternes nach oben in die Galerie gelenkt wurde. Die Galerie ist das eigentliche Beobachtungszentrum gewesen. Sie ist 8,50 Meter hoch, an der Basis 2,25 Meter breit und verjüngt sich nach oben bis auf einen Meter. Man kann sich vorstellen, dass die sich nach oben verjüngende Bauweise ausgezeichnete astronomische Möglichkeiten bot, solange die Abdeckplatten nicht aufgelegt und die Galerie nach oben offen war. Es ist geradezu ideal, mit einem solchen Schlitz (1 m breit und 46,5 m lang) den Sternenhimmel zu beobachten. Das ergab eine ausgezeichnete Möglichkeit, den Gang der Gestirne und die geringste Veränderung zu erkennen. Der englische Astronom Richard Proctor nahm einen Hinweis des griechischen Philosophen Proklos auf, der in einem Kommentar zu Platos Timaios erwähnt, dass die Pyramide vor ihrer Fertigstellung als Observatorium gedient habe. Demnach wäre sie einige Zeit als Pyramidenstumpf geblieben und hätte als Observatorium benutzt werden können. Damit erst erhalten die niederen Gänge, ihre Neigung, die Hinführung zur Galerie ihren Sinn. Gerade die Exaktheit, mit der alles gebaut wurde, passt schlüssig zu der Annahme, dass mit dieser "Apparatur" (Pyramide) das himmelskundliche Wissen erworben wurde, das die alten Ägypter tatsächlich hatten. Irgendwoher mussten sie das Wissen haben, und die Pyramidenforschung zeigt, wie das möglich war. Die Baumeister hatten die Meridianlinie Nord-Süd auf die Pyramide übertragen und legten diese Linie dauerhaft fest durch den absteigenden Gang. Tompkins schreibt: "Nach der Markierung eines Mittelpunktes und einer genauen Meridianlinie konnte man darangehen, die Fundamente für die Ecksteine einer quadratischen Grundfläche zu kennzeichnen und die ersten Steinschichten auf einer vollkommen eingeebneten Terrasse legen". "Proctor suchte für dieses Problem eine Lösung, indem er es nicht vom Standpunkt des Architekten, sondern des Astronomen aus anging. Er stellte sich darum 
Fisica arXiv:gr-qc/0105055 v1   17 May 2001 Black holes are one-dimensional Jacob D. Bekenstein and Avraham E. Mayoy The Racah Institute of Physics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Givat Ram, Jerusalem 91904, Israel Abstract The holographic principle has revealed that physical systems in 3{D space, black holes included, are basically two{dimensional as far as their information content is concerned. This conclusion is complemented by one sketched here: as far as entropy or information  ow is concerned, a black hole behaves as a one{dimensional channel. We de ne a channel in  at spacetime in thermody- namic terms, and contrast it with common entropy emitting systems. A black hole is more like the former: its entropy output is related to the emitted power as it would be for a one-dimensional channel, and disposal of an information stream down a black hole is limited by the power invested in the same way as for a one-dimensional channel.  e{mail: bekenste@vms.huji.ac.il ye{mail:mayo@cc.huji.ac.il 1 The holographic principle [1,2] claims that a generic physical system in three spatial dimensions is fundamentally two-dimensional. This idea is closely connected with the per- ception [2,3], now commonplace, that a black hole in 3{D space is really two-dimensional because its entropy qua measure of lost information is measured by the horizon’s 2{D area. In this essay we point out a further constriction of dimensions: viewed as an information absorber or entropy emitter, a black hole in 3{D is fundamentally one-dimensional, verily a portal to a one-dimensional information channel. To show this one must de ne an information channel. In  at spacetime a channel is a complete set of unidirectionally propagating modes of a  eld parametrized by a single number. For example, all electromagnetic modes in free space with  xed wave vector direc- tion and particular linear polarization constitute a channel, with the modes propagating in the speci ed sense parametrized solely by frequency. One might implement such a channel with a straight in nitely long coaxial cable (which is well known to transmit all frequencies) capped by polaroid  lter at the entrance. Of course, one is not con ned to electromagnetic  eld for sending information; sound (acoustic  eld) or neutrinos will do just as well. How- ever, in this essay we mostly speak in terms of photons. A fundamental question is what is the maximum rate, in quantum theory, at which information may be transmitted in steady state down a photon channel for prescribed power P. The answer was found in the 1960’s [4], but we reconstruct here the much later but very simple derivation of Pendry [5] because of its broad applicability. One thinks of each possible signal state as represented by a particular occupation number state of the various propagating modes of the quantum electromagnetic  eld. Let us assume the channel is uniform in the direction of propagation; this allows us to label the modes by momentum p. One may allow for dispersion so that a quantum with momentum p has some energy "(p). Then the propagation velocity of the quantum is the group velocity  (p) = d"(p)=dp. According to information theory one can identify the information rate capacity for given P with the maximal unidirectional thermodynamic entropy current that the channel can carry for that same P. This maximal entropy current obviously occurs for the thermal state, except that we must restrict attention to modes moving in a de nite sense along the channel. We shall leave out the factor ln 2 which translates from entropy natural units to bits. Now the entropy s(p) of any boson mode of momentump in a thermal state (temperature T) is [6] s(p) = "(p)e"(p)=T 1  ln   1 e "(p)=T   : (1) so the entropy current in one direction is _S = Z 1 0 s(p) (p)dp=2  h; (2) where dp=2  h is the number of modes per unit length in the interval dp which propagate in one direction. This factor, when multiplied by the group velocity, gives the unidirectional current of modes. After an integration by parts on the second term coming from (2), we can cast the last result into the form _S = 2 T Z 1 0 "(p) e"(p)=T 1 d"(p) dp dp 2  h: (3) 2 The  rst factor in the integrand is the mean energy per mode, so that the integral represents the unidirectional power P in the channel. Thus _S = 2P=T: (4) The integral in Eq. (3) is evaluated by cancelling the two di erentials dp and assuming the energy spectrum is single valued and extends from 0 to 1. Then the form of the dispersion relation "(p) does not enter and the result for the power is P =  (T)2=12 h: (5) Eliminating T between the last two expressions gives Pendry’s maximum entropy rate for power P, _S = ( P=3 h)1=2; (6) The function _S(P) in Eq. (6) is also called the noiseless quantum channel capacity. Surprisingly, it is independent, not only of the form of the mode velocity  (p), but also of its scale. Thus the phonon channel capacity is as large as the photon channel capacity despite the di erence in speeds. Why? Although phonons convey information at lower speed, the energy of a phonon is proportionately smaller than that of a photon in the equivalent mode. When the capacity is expressed in terms of the energy  ux, or P, it turns out to involve the same constants. Formula. (6) neatly characterizes what we mean by one-dimensional transmission of entropy or information. It refers to transmission by use of a single species of quantum and a speci c polarization; di erent species and polarizations engender separate channels. For contrast let us derive, still in  at spacetime, the equivalent result for the energy and entropy transmission in a single photon polarization out of a closed hot black body surface with temperature T and area A into 3{D space. Halving the Stefan-Boltzmann law we have P =   2T4A 120h3 (7) as well as _S = 4P=3T (8) whereby _S = 2 3  2 2AP3 15 h3 !1=4 (9) Our 3{D transmission system deviates from the sleek formula (6) not only in the exponent of P but also in the appearance of the measureA of the system. [In emission from a closed curve of length L in two-dimensional space the factor (LP2)1=3 would appear instead of (AP3)1=4]. In  at spacetime we may thus infer the dimensionality of the transmission system from the exponent of P in the expression _S(P) as well as from the value of the coe cient of P=T in expressions for _S like (4) or (8) [(D + 1)=D for D space dimensions]. 3 Turning now to curved spacetime, the radiation from a Schwarzschild black hole of mass M in 3{D space is also given by Eqs. (7)-(8) with A = 4 (2M)2 and T the Hawking temperature TH =  h(8 M) 1, except that we must augment the expression for P by a factor   of order unity (Page [7] has calculated the frequency dependent barrier transmission factor  and this must be averaged over the Planck spectrum to get   ), and replace the 4=3 in the expression for _S by another factor,  (also calculated by Page [8]). Eliminating M between the equations we have instead of Eq. (9) _S =   2   P 480 h !1=2 : (10) This looks completely di erent from the law (9) for the hot closed surface in 3{D space because, unlike for the hot body, a black hole’s temperature is related to its mass in a speci c way. But (10) is of the same form as Pendry’s limit (6) for one-channel  ow. From Page’s numerical estimates [7] we infer   = 1:6267 and take his value [8]  = 1:5003, both for a single photon polarization. With these the numerical coe cient of (10) is 15:1% that of (6). One consequence of the above is that it is possible in principle to collect all the Hawking photon radiation (the former for one polarization) by means of suitable parabolic \mirrors" and \lenses" and pipe it down a single straight photon channel. This even though the black hole emits photons in all directions and thus, seemingly, into a gamut of channels. Evidently in its entropy emission properties, a black hole in 3{D space is more like a 1{D channel than like a surface in 3{D space. We have checked that these conclusions are not qualitatively changed when the entropy is carried by neutrinos. We have emphasized entropy  ow out of the black hole; equally interesting is information  ow into the black hole. One of the characteristics of a black hole is that it acts as a sink of information. Our results can be construed as putting a bound on how fast information may be disposed of into a black hole. Let us assume we have at our disposal a certain power P to accomplish the task of getting rid of a stream of information. We may pick the size of black hole which suits us best. Then by the complementary relation between entropy and information, we may reinterpret formula (10) for entropy rate out of the black hole as also setting a bound on the rate at which information can  ow into the black hole for given P (there is actually a factor ln 2 between them to convert entropy natural units to bits). The one-dimensional character of the black hole is central to this conclusion. One can, of course, improve the disposal rate by harnessing several channels (the second photon polarization, neutrinos, etc.), but the number of these is quite limited in nature. One must thus pay for information disposal into a black hole: the faster we want it done, the more power we have to put in, with the power growing quadratically with the loss of information rate.

April 19-23, 1999 PIEZO-ELECTRIC AND VISCOELASTIC CONTROL OF LIFTING SURFACE AERODYNAMIC DERIVATIVES AND AILERON REVERSAL 1 Cristina E. Beldica 2 and Harry H. Hilton 3 Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering Department National Center for Supercomputing Applications Center for Simulation of Advanced Rockets University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 104 South Wright Street, MC-236 Urbana, IL 61801-2935 USA 4 Keywords: aerodynamic derivatives, aeroviscoelasticity, aileron reversal, control, damping, piezo-electro-viscoelasticity, viscoelasticity. ABSTRACT The present study is part of a series of systematic fundamental investigations into the efiects of damping arising from piezo-thermo-viscoelasticity to control and minimize un- desirable  exible structural contributions in  ight vehicles. Previous research (Beldica et al. 1998a, b; Hilton & Yi 1998) has demonstrated through computer simulations the attrac- tive performance of piezoelectric viscoelastic devices to control aerodynamic noise, divergence and  utter. The present study evaluates time dependent aileron efiectiveness and reversal and aerodynamic derivatives and their control through piezoelectric viscoelastic devices in viscoelastic lifting surfaces. The ultimate aim of these research efiorts is formulate and eval- uate piezo-electro-viscoelastic control of actual high temperature metal and/or composite  ight structures through massively parallel computations. The theory of aeroelasticity is well established and may be found described in detail in such classical texts as Bisplinghofi et al. (1955) among others. Analyses of viscoelastic damping efiects (Hilton 1957, 1960, 1993) have shown that energy dissipation due to mate- rial and/or structural damping may produce either stabilizing or destabilizing contributions 1 Copyright c 1999 by the authors.

This phenomenon leads to viscoelastic  utter velocities which are either smaller or larger than corresponding elastic ones for aerodynamic, dynamic and geometric identical lift- ing surfaces. Recent, formulations and analyses of piezo-thermo-viscoelastic efiects (Hilton, Vinson & Yi 1997) have demonstrated that su–cient power can be generated by viscoelastic piezo-electric devices to efiectively in uence and control static and dynamic motion. A pre- liminary investigation of viscoelastic efiects on  ight structures without piezoelectric control was carried out by Jackson (1969). In order to reduce the number of parameters to a minimum, a rigid lifting surface on a  exible two degree of freedom support (Fig. 1, vertical h(t) and rotational  (t) motions) is used as a typical vehicle for the present diagnostic fundamental sensitivity study. The piezo- electric viscoelastic supports consist of torsional and vertical devices. The linear anisotropic constitutive relations at constant temperatures in Cartesian coordinates x i of the  exible supports are given by (Hilton et al. 1997)   ij (x;t)= t Z ¡1 ` ijkl (x;t;t 0 ) @† kl (x;t 0 ) @t 0 dt 0 ¡ t Z ¡1 ` E ijl (x;t;t 0 ) @ b E l (x;t 0 ) @t 0 dt 0 (1) and D i ( ;t 0 )= t Z ¡1 ` E ikl (x;t;t 0 ) @† kl (x;t 0 ) @t 0 dt 0 + t Z ¡1 ` E il (x;t;t 0 ) @ b E l (x;t 0 ) @t 0 dt 0 (2) where   ij are the stress tensors, † kl the strain tensors, ` ijkl the anisotropic linear viscoelastic relaxation functions, ` E ijl the electrical viscoelastic relaxation functions or the piezoelectric stress/charge matrix, ` E il the dielectric permittivity matrix, b E l the electrical fleld intensity vectors, and D i the electric displacement vectors. In the interest of space saving, only the linear example for a rotational motion will be exhibited here, which relates the angle of attack fi(t)=fi r + (t)+ _ h(t)=U r and the aileron de ection angle fl to the aerodynamic moment, polar mass moment of inertia I p , viscoelastic stifiness and piezo-electric parameters as I p @ 2 fi(t) @t 2 = K 1 t Z ¡1 ˆ(t;t 0 ) @M T (t 0 ) @t 0 dt 0 ¡ K 2 t Z ¡1 ˆ E (t;t 0 ) @ b E(t 0 ) @t 0 dt 0 (3) and D(t 0 )=K 3 t Z ¡1 ˆ E (t;t 0 ) @M T (t 0 ) @t 0 dt 0 + t Z ¡1 ˆ E (t;t 0 ) @ b E(t 0 ) @t 0 dt 0 (4) where the aerodynamic moment M T (t)is 2         M T (t)=qA ( e ˆ @C L @fi fi(t)+ @C L @fl fl ! + c @C MAC @fl fl ) (5) where q is the dynamic pressure and A the wing area. It is to be noted that these are coupled relations in the angle of twist  (t) and elec- tric potential b E(t). When the second DOF is introduced, then Eqs. (3) and (4) become additionally dependent on the vertical motion h(t) and a third relation is required for the translatory equilibrium involving fi, h and b E. The vertical motion h(t) depends on the lift L(t)=L[ (t); _ h(t)=U r ]. In general, _ h(t)=U r <<  (t) and important fundamental insight can be gained by considering a single DOF motion with _ h(t) = 0 by restricting the vertical motion. A second class of problems investigated is that of an antisymmetric lift distribution produced by aileron de ections fl of opposite signs on the left and right wings of semi-span L and producing a rolling velocity p(t). This necessitates the addition to M T of the terms ¢M T (t)=qA ( @C L @ep ep(t)+Nm_p(t)d ) (6) where m is the mass, N the load factor and ep(t)=p(t)L=U r . The structural damping contribution can be included in the relaxation function `,such that for linear viscoelastic materials it is `(t)=G 0 (1 + {g)+ N X n=1 G n exp[¡t=¿ n ] (7) where P N n=0 G n is the elastic shear modulus of the torsional restraint and g is the structural damping coe–cient of the joint with { = p ¡1. The parameters G n , ¿ n and N are viscoelastic material properties. The viscoelastic piezoelectric relaxation functions ` E are representable by similar Prony series, but with distinct parameters and with g = 0, such that ` E (t)=G E 0 + N E X n=1 G E n exp[¡t=¿ E n ] (8) In the flrst class of problems for symmetric lift distributions, one solves for a time t R > 0 at specifled  ight speed U and angles fi r and fl when aileron reversal occurs (zero lift) and M T (t R ) = 0. The velocity U is, of course, less than the elastic reversal speed, since the viscoelastic initial conditions are the corresponding elastic solutions. Consequently, for a creeping viscoelastic lifting surface, aileron reversal is only a matter of time provided creep divergence does not occur flrst (Fig. 2). In other words, for a given constant  ight velocity, U r , proper applications of viscoelastic piezoelectric control will delay or prevent creep control 3          reversal and degradation of aerodynamic derivatives. Fig. 2 also indicates that for a given life time in order to avoid reversal without piezoelectric control, smaller fls must be applied. The latter procedure is self defeating from a  ight control point of view since it results in reduced rolling rates _p(t), while torsional creep increases  (t) leading to larger symmetric lift values eventually causing creep divergence. In the case of an atmospheric missile one need only assure that its  ight time is less than either the aileron reversal or divergence time for mission survival and adequate aerodynamic control. In the unsymmetric lift case, for either a specifled rolling velocity p(t) or a load factorN, one can determine the aerodynamic rolling moment coe–cients (derivatives) @ep=@fl = ep fl (t) and thus measure aileron efiectiveness. i. e. the largerjep fl j the more pronounced the aileron rolling control. Figs. 3 and 4 show typical preliminary viscoelastic results at  ight velocities below the corresponding elastic control reversal speed and for a prescribed constant aileron de ection fl. In both instances it is seen that control reversal will take place in time if no corrective piezo-electric control is applied ( b E = 0). On the other hand, depending on the supplied voltage, one can over or under control aileron efiectiveness. Active or passive additional system control can be achieved by prescribing either the elec- tric displacement D(t) by providing suitable voltages b E(t) or by controlling the output b E(t) through suitable resistors. Neither pose serious additional weight problems to  ight vehicles. Preliminary parametric studies show that increases in structural temperatures and/or mois- ture contents shorten times to achieve aileron reversal and decrease its efiectiveness jep(t)j. Additional parametric studies are in progress and their results will be included in the full AIAA paper. PARTIAL LIST OF REFERENCES Cristina E. Beldica, Harry H.

I will describe the standard Big Bang theory of the evolution of the universe, with its successes and shortcomings, which will lead to inflationary cosmology as the paradigm for the origin of the global structure of the universe as well as the origin of the spectrum of density perturbations responsible for structure in our local patch. I will present a review of the very rich phenomenology that we have in cosmology today, as well as evidence for the observational revolution that this field is going through, which will provide us, in the next few years, with an accurate determination of the parameters of our standard cosmological model. 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION Cosmology (from the Greek: kosmos, universe, world, order, and logos, word, theory) is probably the most ancient body of knowledge, dating from as far back as the predictions of seasons by early civiliza- tions. Yet, until recently, we could only answer to some of its more basic questions with an order of mag- nitude estimate. This poor state of affairs has dramatically changed in the last few years, thanks to (what else?) raw data, coming from precise measurements of a wide range of cosmological parameters. Further- more, we are entering a precision era in cosmology, and soon most of our observables will be measured with a few percent accuracy. We are truly living in the Golden Age of Cosmology. It is a very exciting time and I will try to communicate this enthusiasm to you. Important results are coming out almost every month from a large set of experiments, which pro- vide crucial information about the universe origin and evolution; so rapidly that these notes will proba- bly be outdated before they are in print as a CERN report. In fact, some of the results I mentioned dur- ing the Summer School have already been improved, specially in the area of the microwave background anisotropies. Nevertheless, most of the new data can be interpreted within a coherent framework known as the standard cosmological model, based on the Big Bang theory of the universe and the inflationary paradigm, which is with us for two decades. I will try to make such a theoretical model accesible to young experimental particle physicists with little or no previous knowledge about general relativity and curved space-time, but with some knowledge of quantum field theory and the standard model of particle physics. 2. INTRODUCTION TO BIG BANG COSMOLOGY Our present understanding of the universe is based upon the successful hot Big Bang theory, which ex- plains its evolution from the first fraction of a second to our present age, around 13 billion years later. This theory rests upon four strong pillars, a theoretical framework based on general relativity, as put for- ward by Albert Einstein [1] and Alexander A. Friedmann [2] in the 1920s, and three robust observational facts: First, the expansion of the universe, discovered by Edwin P. Hubble [3] in the 1930s, as a reces- sion of galaxies at a speed proportional to their distance from us. Second, the relative abundance of light elements, explained by George Gamow [4] in the 1940s, mainly that of helium, deuterium and lithium, which were cooked from the nuclear reactions that took place at around a second to a few minutes after the Big Bang, when the universe was a few times hotter than the core of the sun. Third, the cosmic mi- crowave background (CMB), the afterglow of the Big Bang, discovered in 1965 by Arno A. Penzias and 109         Robert W. Wilson [5] as a very isotropic blackbody radiation at a temperature of about 3 degrees Kelvin, emitted when the universe was cold enough to form neutral atoms, and photons decoupled from matter, approximately 500,000 years after the Big Bang. Today, these observations are confirmed to within a few percent accuracy, and have helped establish the hot Big Bang as the preferred model of the universe. 2.1 Friedmann–Robertson–Walker universes Where are we in the universe? During our lectures, of course, we were in ?Casta Papierni?cka, in ‘the heart of Europe’, on planet Earth, rotating (8 light-minutes away) around the Sun, an ordinary star 8.5 kpc1 from the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, which is part of the local group, within the Virgo cluster of galaxies (of size a few Mpc), itself part of a supercluster (of sizea0 a1a3a2a4a2 Mpc), within the visible universe (a0a6a5a8a7a10a9a12a11 a1a3a2a4a2a3a2 Mpc), most probably a tiny homogeneous patch of the infinite global structure of space- time, much beyond our observable universe. Cosmology studies the universe as we see it. Due to our inherent inability to experiment with it, its origin and evolution has always been prone to wild speculation. However, cosmology was born as a science with the advent of general relativity and the realization that the geometry of space-time, and thus the general attraction of matter, is determined by the energy content of the universe [6], a13a15a14a17a16a19a18a21a20a22a14a17a16a24a23 a1 a25a27a26 a14a17a16a28a20a30a29a32a31a34a33a35a13a37a36a38a14a17a16a24a39a41a40 a26 a14a17a16a43a42 (1) These non-linear equations are simply too difficult to solve without some insight coming from the sym- metries of the problem at hand: the universe itself. At the time (1917-1922) the known (observed) uni- verse extended a few hundreds of parsecs away, to the galaxies in the local group, Andromeda and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds: The universe looked extremely anisotropic. Nevertheless, both Ein- stein and Friedmann speculated that the most ‘reasonable’ symmetry for the universe at large should be homogeneity at all points, and thus isotropy. It was not until the detection, a few decades later, of the microwave background by Penzias and Wilson that this important assumption was finally put onto firm experimental ground. So, what is the most general metric satisfying homogeneity and isotropy at large scales? The Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric, written here in terms of the invariant geodesic distancea44a28a45a47a46 a29 a26a14a17a16a44a49a48 a14 a44a49a48 a16 in four dimensions,a50 a29 a2a3a51a10a1a3a51a10a25a3a51a49a52 , see Ref. [6],2 a44a53a45a46 a29 a44a49a54a46 a23a56a55 a46a4a57a54a59a58 a44a49a60a46 a1 a23a56a61 a60a46 a39 a60a46a3a57a44a28a62a46 a39a41a63a17a64a65 a46 a62a66a44a53a67 a46a58 a51 (2) characterized by just two quantities, a scale factora55a57a54a59a58 , which determines the physical size of the universe, and a constanta61 , which characterizes the spatial curvature of the universe, a68a8a69a17a70 a20a30a29 a71 a61 a55 a46 a57a54a59a58 a42 a61a72a29a21a23 a1 a73a75a74a35a76a78a77 a61a72a29 a2 a79a81a80a83a82a85a84 a61a72a29a21a39 a1 a86a87a80a88a73a75a89a90a76a35a91 (3) Spatially open, flat and closed universes have different geometries. Light geodesics on these universes behave differently, and thus could in principle be distinguished observationally, as we shall discuss later. Apart from the three-dimensional spatial curvature, we can also compute a four-dimensional space-time curvature, a68a8a92a93a70 a20a30a29 a71 a94a55 a55 a39 a71 a95a55 a55 a46 a39 a71 a61 a55 a46 a42 (4) Depending on the dynamics (and thus on the matter/energy content) of the universe, we will have different possible outcomes of its evolution. The universe may expand for ever, recollapse in the future or approach an asymptotic state in between. 1One parallax second (1 pc), parsec for short, corresponds to a distance of about 3.26 light-years or a96a43a97a99a98a101a100a28a102a104a103 cm. 2I am using a105a66a106a107a98 everywhere, unless specified. 110       2.1.1 The expansion of the universe In 1929, Edwin P. Hubble observed a redshift in the spectra of distant galaxies, which indicated that they were receding from us at a velocity proportional to their distance to us [3]. This was correctly interpreted as mainly due to the expansion of the universe, that is, to the fact that the scale factor today is larger than when the photons were emitted by the observed galaxies. For simplicity, consider the metric of a spatially flat universe, a44a28a45a46 a29 a44a10a54a46 a23a32a55a46a57a54a10a58a83a44a81a108a48 a46 (the generalization of the following argument to curved space is straightforward). The scale factora55a57a54a10a58 gives physical size to the spatial coordinates a108a48 , and the expansion is nothing but a change of scale (of spatial units) with time. Except for peculiar velocities, i.e. motion due to the local attraction of matter, galaxies do not move in coordinate space, it is the space-time fabric which is stretching between galaxies. Due to this continuous stretching, the observed wavelength of photons coming from distant objects is greater than when they were emitted by a factor precisely equal to the ratio of scale factors, a109a28a110a112a111a59a113 a109a28a114a101a115 a29 a55a17a116 a55 a18 a1 a39a56a117 a51 (5) wherea55a116 is the present value of the scale factor. Since the universe today is larger than in the past, the observed wavelengths will be shifted towards the red, or redshifted, by an amount characterized bya117 , the redshift parameter. In the context of a FRW metric, the universe expansion is characterized by a quantity known as the Hubble rate of expansion,a118 a57a54a10a58 a29 a95a55a57a54a59a58a120a119a55a57a54a10a58 , whose value today is denoted bya118 a116 . As I shall deduce later, it is possible to compute the relation between the physical distancea44a17a121 and the present rate of expansion, in terms of the redshift parameter,3 a118 a116 a44a17a121 a29a21a117a15a39 a1 a25 a57 a1 a23a123a122a116 a58 a117 a46 a39a56a124 a57 a117 a69 a58 a42 (6) At small distances from us, i.e. ata117a126a125 a1 , we can safely keep only the linear term, and thus the recession velocity becomes proportional to the distance from us,a127 a29a129a128a130a117a131a29 a118 a116 a44a17a121 , the proportionality constant being the Hubble rate, a118 a116 . This expression constitutes the so-called Hubble law, and is spectacularly confirmed by a huge range of data, up to distances of hundreds of megaparsecs. In fact, only recently measurements from very bright and distant supernovae, ata117a133a132 a1 , were obtained, and are beginning to probe the second-order term, proportional to the deceleration parameter a122a134a116 , see Eq. (22). I will come back to these measurements in Section 3. One may be puzzled as to why do we see such a stretching of space-time. Indeed, if all spatial distances are scaled with a universal scale factor, our local measuring units (our rulers) should also be stretched, and therefore we should not see the difference when comparing the two distances (e.g. the two wavelengths) at different times. The reason we see the difference is because we live in a gravitationally bound system, decoupled from the expansion of the universe: local spatial units in these systems are not stretched by the expansion.4 The wavelengths of photons are stretched along their geodesic path from one galaxy to another. In this consistent world picture, galaxies are like point particles, moving as a fluid in an expanding universe. 2.1.2 The matter and energy content of the universe So far I have only discussed the geometrical aspects of space-time. Let us now consider the matter and energy content of such a universe. The most general matter fluid consistent with the assumption of ho- mogeneity and isotropy is a perfect fluid, one in which an observer comoving with the fluid would see the universe around it as isotropic. The energy momentum tensor associated with such a fluid can be written as [6] a36 a14a17a16 a29a136a135 a26 a14a17a16 a39 a57 a135a137a39a41a138 a58a83a139 a14 a139 a16 a51 (7) 3The subscript a140 refers to Luminosity, which characterizes the amount of light emitted by an object. See Eq. (61). 4The local space-time of a gravitationally bound system is described by the Schwarzschild metric, which is static [6]. 111    wherea135 a57a54a59a58 anda138 a57a54a59a58 are the pressure and energy density of the fluid at a given time in the expansion, and a139 a14 is the comoving four-velocity, satisfyinga139 a14 a139 a14 a29a21a23 a1 . Let us now write the equations of motion of such a fluid in an expanding universe. According to general relativity, these equations can be deduced from the Einstein equations (1), where we substitute the FRW metric (2) and the perfect fluid tensor (7). Thea50 a29a21a141a142a29 a2 component of the Einstein equations constitutes the so-called Friedmann equation a118 a46 a29 a95a55 a55 a46 a29 a31a59a33a35a13 a52 a138a19a39 a40 a52 a23 a61 a55 a46 a51 (8) where I have treated the cosmological constanta40 as a different component from matter. In fact, it can be associated with the vacuum energy of quantum field theory, although we still do not understand why should it have such a small value (120 orders of magnitude below that predicted by quantum theory), if it is non-zero. This constitutes today one of the most fundamental problems of physics, let alone cosmology. The conservation of energy (a36 a14a17a16a8a143 a16 a29 a2 ), a direct consequence of the general covariance of the theory (a13 a14a17a16a143 a16 a29 a2 ), can be written in terms of the FRW metric and the perfect fluid tensor (7) as a44 a44a49a54 a138a99a55 a69 a39a41a135 a44 a44a49a54 a55 a69 a29 a2a66a51 (9) where the energy density and pressure can be split into its matter and radiation components,a138a144a29a136a138a28a145a107a39a146a138a148a147 a51 a135a149a29a150a135a53a145a151a39a152a135a53a147 , with corresponding equations of state,a135a53a145a72a29 a2a3a51 a135a3a147a32a29a150a138a28a147 a119 a52 . Together, the Friedmann and the energy-conservation equation give the evolution equation for the scale factor, a94a55 a55 a29a21a23a136a153 a33a35a13 a52 a57 a138a19a39 a52a135 a58 a39 a40 a52 a51 (10) I will now make a few useful definitions. We can write the Hubble parameter todaya118 a116 in units of 100 km sa154a130a155 Mpca154a38a155 , in terms of which one can estimate the order of magnitude for the present size and age of the universe, a118 a116 a29 a1a4a2a3a2a66a156a56a157a38a158 a63 a154a38a155a34a159a161a160a81a162a49a154a38a155 a51 (11) a128 a118 a154a130a155 a116 a29 a52a4a2a3a2a4a2a66a156 a154a38a155a66a159a161a160a81a162 a51 (12) a118 a154a130a155 a116 a29 a163a4a42a165a164a4a164a52a81a156 a154a38a155a35a166a22a167a148a168 a42 (13) The parametera156 has been measured to be in the rangea2a42a153a170a169 a156 a169 a1 for decades, and only in the last few years has it been found to lie within 10% ofa156 a29 a2a42a71a4a171 . I will discuss those recent measurements in the next Section. One can also define a critical densitya138a27a172 , that which in the absence of a cosmological constant would correspond to a flat universe, a138 a172 a18 a52 a118 a46 a116 a31a34a33a78a13 a29 a1a42a173a31a3a31 a156 a46 a1a4a2 a154a46a112a174a35a175 a119a162 a158 a69 (14) a29 a25a42a173a164a3a164 a156 a154a38a155 a1a4a2 a155a112a155a35a176a136a177 a119a57 a156 a154a38a155a130a159a161a160a178a162a58 a69 a51 (15) wherea176a152a177 a29 a1a42a165a163a4a31a3a163 a11 a1a4a2 a69a112a69 g is a solar mass unit. The critical densitya138a148a172 corresponds to approximately 4 protons per cubic meter, certainly a very dilute fluid! In terms of the critical density it is possible to define the ratiosa179a66a180 a18a136a138 a180a181a119a138a148a172 , for matter, radiation, cosmological constant and even curvature, today, a179 a145a150a29 a31a59a33a35a13a37a138a28a145 a52 a118 a46 a116 a179 a147a182a29 a31a34a33a35a13a37a138a148a147 a52 a118 a46 a116 (16) a179a81a183 a29 a40 a52 a118 a46 a116 a179a66a184 a29a32a23 a61 a55 a46 a116 a118 a46 a116 a42 (17) 112       We can evaluate today the radiation componenta179 a147 , corresponding to relativistic particles, from the density of microwave background photons,a138a38a185a17a186a130a187a188a29a190a189a27a191 a155a193a192 a57a120a194 a36a66a185a17a186a130a187 a58 a92 a119a57a112a195 a156 a128 a58 a69 a29 a153 a42 a171 a11 a1a4a2 a154 a69a112a92 a175 a119a162 a158 a69 , which givesa179 a185a17a186a130a187 a29 a25a42a153 a11 a1a4a2a154a148a192 a156 a154a46 . Three massless neutrinos contribute an even smaller amount. Therefore, we can safely neglect the contribution of relativistic particles to the total density of the universe today, which is dominated either by non-relativistic particles (baryons, dark matter or massive neutrinos) or by a cosmological constant, and write the rate of expansiona118a170a46 in terms of its value today, a118 a46a57 a55 a58 a29 a118 a46 a116 a179 a147 a55 a92 a116 a55 a92 a39 a179 a145 a55 a69 a116 a55 a69 a39 a179a178a183 a39 a179a66a184 a55 a46 a116 a55 a46 a42 (18) An interesting consequence of these redefinitions is that I can now write the Friedmann equation today, a55a19a29a21a55a17a116 , as a cosmic sum rule, a1 a29 a179 a145a196a39 a179a81a183 a39 a179a66a184 a51 (19) where we have neglecteda179 a147 today. That is, in the context of a FRW universe, the total fraction of matter density, cosmological constant and spatial curvature today must add up to one. For instance, if we measure one of the three components, say the spatial curvature, we can deduce the sum of the other two. Making use of the cosmic sum rule today, we can write the matter and cosmological constant as a function of the scale factor (a55a17a116a75a18 a1 ) a179 a145 a57 a55 a58 a29 a31a59a33a35a13a37a138a28a145 a52 a118 a46a57 a55 a58 a29 a179 a145 a55a24a39 a179 a145 a57 a1 a23a56a55 a58 a39 a179a81a183 a57 a55 a69 a23a56a55 a58 a197a199a198 a116 a23a201a200 a1 a197a199a198a75a202 a23a38a200 a2 a51 (20) a179a81a183 a57 a55 a58 a29 a40 a52 a118 a46a57 a55 a58 a29 a179 a183 a55 a69 a55a24a39 a179 a145 a57 a1 a23a123a55 a58 a39 a179a81a183 a57 a55 a69 a23a56a55 a58 a197a199a198 a116 a23a201a200 a2 a197a199a198a75a202 a23a38a200 a1 a42 (21) This implies that for sufficiently early times, a55a203a125 a1 , all matter-dominated FRW universes can be de- scribed by Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) models (a179 a184 a29 a2a4a51 a179 a183 a29 a2 ).5 On the other hand, the vacuum energy will always dominate in the future. Another relationship which becomes very useful is that of the cosmological deceleration parameter today,a122a116 , in terms of the matter and cosmological constant components of the universe, see Eq. (10), a122a116 a18a21a23 a94a55 a55 a118 a46 a116 a29 a1 a25 a179 a145a30a23 a179a81a183 a51 (22) which is independent of the spatial curvature. Uniform expansion corresponds toa122a116 a29 a2 and requires a precise cancellation: a179 a145a204a29 a25a179a178a183 . It represents spatial sections that are expanding at a fixed rate, its scale factor growing by the same amount in equally-spaced time intervals. Accelerated expansion corresponds toa122a112a116 a169 a2 and comes about whenevera179 a145 a169 a25a179a81a183 : spatial sections expand at an increasing rate, their scale factor growing at a greater speed with each time interval. Decelerated expansion corresponds toa122a116a206a205 a2 and occurs whenevera179 a145 a205 a25a179a81a183 : spatial sections expand at a decreasing rate, their scale factor growing at a smaller speed with each time interval. 2.1.3 Mechanical analogy It is enlightening to work with a mechanical analogy of the Friedmann equation. Let us rewrite Eq. (8) as a1 a25 a95a55 a46 a23 a13 a176 a55 a23 a40 a71 a55 a46 a29a21a23 a61 a25 a29 a162a181a207 a65a90a63a120a208a93a209a59a65a28a208 a51 (23) wherea176 a18 a92 a189 a69 a138a24a55 a69 is the equivalent of mass for the whole volume of the universe. Equation (23) can be understood as the energy conservation lawa210 a29a32a36a21a39a212a211 for a test particle of unit mass in the central potential a211 a57a60a90a58 a29a32a23 a13 a176 a60 a39 a1 a25 a194 a60a46 a51 (24) 5Note that in the limit a213a24a214a56a100 the radiation component starts dominating, see Eq. (18), but we still recover the EdS model. 113

In more usual notations and words, the problem is to investigate the dy- namics of a canonical system of di?erential equations with Hamiltonian (1) H(p,q,?)=H 0 (p)+?H 1 (p,q)+? 2 H 2 (p,q)+... , where p ? (p 1 ,...,p n ) ?G?R n are action variables in the open set G, q?(q 1 ,...,q n ) ?T n are angle variables, and ? is a small parameter. The lectures by Giancarlo Benettin, Jacques Henrard and Sergej Kuksin published in the present book address some of the many questions that are hidden behind the simple sentence above. 1. A Classical Problem It is well known that the investigations of Poincar´e were motivated by a clas- sical problem: the stability of the Solar System. The three volumes of the VI Preface M´ethodes Nouvelles had been preceded by the memoir Sur le probl`eme des trois corps et les ´equations de la dynamique; m´emoire couronn´eduprixde S. M. le Roi Oscar II le 21 janvier 1889. It may be interesting to recall the subject of the investigation, as stated in the announcement of the competition for King Oscar’s prize: “ A system being given of a number whatever of particles attracting one another mutually according to Newton’s law, it is proposed, on the assumption that there never takes place an impact of two particles to expand the coordinates of each particle in a series pro- ceeding according to some known functions of time and converging uniformly for any space of time. ” In the announcement it is also mentioned that the question was suggested by a claim made by Lejeune–Dirichlet in a letter to a friend that he had been able to demonstrate the stability of the solar system by integrating the di?erential equations of Mechanics. However, Dirichlet died shortly after, and no reference to his method was actually found in his notes. As a matter of fact, in his memoir and in the M´ethodes Nouvelles Poincar´e seems to end up with di?erent conclusions. Just to mention a few results of his work, let me recall the theorem on generic non–existence of first integrals, the recurrence theorem, the divergence of classical perturbation series as a typical fact, the discovery of asymptotic solutions and the existence of homoclinic points. Needless to say, the work of Poincar´e represents the starting point of most of the research on dynamical systems in the XX–th century. It has also been said that the memoir on the problem of three bodies is “the first textbook in the qualitative theory of dynamical systems”, perhaps forgetting that the qualitative study of dynamics had been undertaken by Poincar´einaM´emoire sur les courbes d´efinies par une ´equation di?´erentielle, published in 1882. 2. KAM Theory Let me recall a few known facts about the system (1). For ? = 0 the Hamilto- nian possesses n first integrals p 1 ,...,p n that are independent, and the orbits lie on invariant tori carrying periodic or quasi–periodic motions with frequen- cies ? 1 (p),...,? n (p), where ? j (p)= ?H 0 ?p j . This is the unperturbed dynamics. For ?negationslash= 0 this plain behaviour is destroyed, and the problem is to understand how the dynamics actually changes. The classical methods of perturbation theory, as started by Lagrange and Laplace, may be resumed by saying that one tries to prove that for ? negationslash=0 the system (1) is still integrable. However, this program encountered major di?culties due to the appearance in the expansions of the so called secular

We obtain an exact solution of the master equation, which con rms this result. We also discuss the conditions required to create a macroscopic Schr odinger cat state in the cantilever. 1 Introduction The routine magnetic force microscopy (MFM) seems to be of a little use for a single spin detection in solids. Even for unrealistically small distances between the ferromagnetic particle on the cantilever tip and the spin, the maximum temperature for a single-spin measurement comes to a millikelvin region [1]. In this paper, we show that using a transient process, one can increase the maximum temperature of a single-spin measurement by a factor of Q (the quality factor of the cantilever). Alternatively, one can increase the distance between the ferromagnetic particle and the cantilever tip if one is willing to work at millikelvin temperatures. 1 In section 2 we explain the basic idea of our work. In sections 3-5 we obtain an exact solution of the master equations, which con rms our idea. In section 6 we derive the conditions for creating a macroscopic Schr odinger cat state (MSCS) in MFM. In Conclusion we summarize our results. 2 Transient Process in MFM In this section we describe the basic idea of our work. Suppose that a ferro- magnetic particle on the cantilever tip interacts with a single spin on the solid surface. (See Fig. 1.) The equilibrium position of the cantilever tip depends on the spin direction. The distance between two possible equilibrium posi- tions, corresponding to two spin stationary states, is given by 2F=kc, where kc is the cantilever spring constant, F is the magneto-static force between the ferromagnetic particle and the spin. In order to measure the state of the spin, this distance must be greater than twice the uncertainty due to the thermodynamical noise of the cantilever position. This uncertainty can be estimated as (kBT=kc)1=2, where kB is the Boltzmann’s constant and T is the temperature. Thus, the condition for a single spin measurement (the static Stern-Gerlach e ect) is [1] T <Tmax = F2=kBkc: (1) Now, assume that we quickly change the stationary state of the spin and consider the transient cantilever vibrations after this change. The amplitude of the cantilever vibrations at time t Q=!c (!c is the cantilever frequency and Q=!c is the time constant of the cantilever) is 4F=kc. In addition, as- sume that we detect the position and momentum of a point on the cantilever tip with an accuracy that satis es the quantum limit ( PZ)( Z)   h=2 (the cantilever oscillates along the z-axis.) To  nd out the state of the spin we are going to compare the observed trajectory of the cantilever tip with the theoretical prediction. The theory predicts the cantilever trajectory within an uncertainty due to the thermal noise. However, the thermal uncertainty of the cantilever position at time t  Q=!c increases as [t(!c=Q)(kBT=kc)]1=2. We can obtain this expression assuming an initial (t  Q=!c) thermal dif- fusion with two common properties: 1) The dispersion ( Z)2 is proportional 2 to time, t, and 2) The uncertainty of the cantilever position equals its ther- modynamical value if we formally put t = Q=!c. At the time t =  =!c (half of the  rst period), the distance between two possible cantilever positions takes its maximum possible value 4F=kc. At the same time, the thermal uncertainty of the position predicted by the theory is still much smaller than its thermodynamical value. Now, the condition for a single spin measurement is T <Tmax = 4QF 2  kBkc: (2) One can see that the maximum temperature for a single spin measurement increases by a factor of Q, compared with the static Stern-Gerlach e ect. In the next three sections, we will con rm this estimation by direct solu- tion of the master equation. 3 The Hamiltonian and the Master Equation We assume that the cantilever tip with an attached ferromagnetic particle can oscillate along the z-axis. (See Fig. 1.) A single paramagnetic atom with spin 1=2 is placed near the cantilever tip. The dimensionless Hamiltonian of the cantilever tip interacting with a single spin is ^H = 1 2(^p 2 z + ^z 2) 2 ^z^Sz: (3) We introduced the following notation (below we omit hats for operators): z = Z=Zq; pz = Pz=Pq;  = g B         @Bz @z        =2Fq ; (4) where Zq, Pq and Fq are the \quants" of the coordinate, momentum and force acting on the cantilever, Zq =   h! c kc !1=2 ; Pq =  h=Zq; Fq = kcZq: (5) 3 The variables Z and Pz are the \dimensional" coordinate and momentum of the cantilever tip, kc is the cantilever \spring constant", !c is its frequency, g is the \g-factor" of the spin (below we use g = 2), @Bz=@z is the magnetic  eld gradient produced by the ferromagnetic particle at the spin location when the cantilever is in the equilibrium position with no spin (z = 0). Note that the cantilever interacts with the z-component of the spin, which is an integral of motion in our system. In the Hamiltonian (3) we omitted the term (g BB0= h!c)^Sz, where B0 is the magnetic  eld on the spin when the cantilever is at the origin (z = 0). This term may be eliminated \physically" (by application of a uniform external  eld of magnitude B0 in the negative z- direction) or \mathematically" (by transferring to the system of coordinates rotating with the frequency g BB0= h). The master equation describes the evolution of the density matrix of the system interacting with the environment (see for example [2-5]). We are tak- ing into account the interaction of the cantilever with its environment, and ignore the direct interaction between the spin and the environment, assum- ing that the spin relaxation and decoherence times are large enough. The e ect of the environment depends on its \spectral density", i.e. the den- sity of environmental oscillators at a given frequency. Probably, the simplest model of the environment is the \ohmic" model, where the spectral density is proportional to the frequency ! for !<  , where  is the cuto frequency for the environment. A master equation for the non-ohmic environment has been derived in [5]. For the ohmic model, the simplest master equation has been obtained in [2]. This equation is valid in the \high temperature limit" kBT >>  h . The master equation derived in [3] is valid for arbitrary temper- ature. As pointed out in [5], both equations [2] and [3] fail at times shorter than or close to  h=kBT. We are going to consider the \gedanken experiment" discussed in [1]. Sup- pose that initially (t = 0) the spin is in a superposition of the two states with thez-projection of the spinSz = 1=2 andSz =  1=2. These two states of the spin correspond to two di erent equilibrium positions of the cantilever tip. Thus, the cantilever (without decoherence) would transform into a MSCS: two simultaneous equilibrium positions. Certainly, decoherence will destroy this state. The master equation describes both the appearance of the MSCS and its destruction due to decoherence. 4 Following [1], we consider the ultra-thin cantilever reported on [6]. It has the spring constant kc = 6:5 10 6 N=m, the frequency, !c=2 = 1:7 kHz, and the quality factor, Q = 6700. The ferromagnetic particle on the can- tilever tip is taken to be a sphere of radius R = 15 nm at a distance 5 nm from the paramagnetic atom. (Below we consider conditions for increasing the distance between the cantilever and spin.) For this case, the static dis- placement of the cantilever tip due to its interaction with the single spin exceeds the thermal vibrations of the cantilever for temperatures T <Tmax = ( B@Bz=@z) 2 kBkc  1:7 mK : (6) In our gedanken experiment for the temperatureT >>  h!c=kB  8 10 8 K, we can use the simplest high temperature limit in the \ohmic model". The master equation in the high temperature limit can be written in the form [2] @ s;s0 @ = " i 2 (@zz  @z0z0)  i2(z2  z02) 12 (z z0)(@z  @z0) D (z z0)2  2i (z0s0  zs) #  s;s0: (7) Here, s and s0 take values  1=2 (we use s instead of Sz),  = !ct,  = 1=Q and D = kBT= h!c. Using new coordinates r = z z0; R = 12(z +z0): (8) Eq. (7) can be written as: @ s;s0(R;r; ) @ =   i@Rr  iRr  r@r  D r2  i    (2R r)s0  (2R+r)s     s;s0(R;r; ): (9) 5

Fisica arXiv:gr-qc/0302073 v1   18 Feb 2003 Black Hole Thermodynamics and Riemann Surfaces ? Kirill Krasnov† Albert Einstein Institute, Golm/Potsdam, 14476, Germany and School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Nottingham University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK February, 2003 Abstract We use the analytic continuation procedure proposed in our earlier works to study the thermodynamics of black holes in 2+1 dimensions. A general black hole in 2+1 dimensions has g handles hidden behind h horizons. The result of the analytic continuation is a hyperbolic 3-manifold having the topology of a handlebody. The boundary of this handlebody is a compact Riemann surface of genus G = 2g +h?1. Conformal moduli of this surface encode in a simple way the physical characteristicsof the black hole. The moduli space of black holes of a given type (g,h) is then the Schottky space at genus G. The (logarithm of the) thermodynamic partition function of the hole is the K¨ahler potential for the Weil-Peterson metric on the Schottky space. Bekenstein bound on the black hole entropy leads us to conjecture a new strong bound on this K¨ahler potential. ?Expanded version of a talk given in the Math Department, SUNY, Stony Brook and in the Physics Department, University of Maryland. †krasnov@aei.mpg.de 1 Introduction In this paper we use the analytic continuation procedure proposed in [1, 2] to study the thermo- dynamics of black hole (BH) solutions of 2+1 gravity with negative cosmological constant. The simplest such black hole was described by Banados, Teitelboim, Zanelli [3]. Later black holes with non-trivial internal topology were discovered [4]. The standard strategy for studying BH thermodynamics is to analytically continue the hole spacetime. The (exponential of the) classical Einstein-Hilbert action evaluated on the resulting Euclidean metric is then the BH partition function. The later can be used to obtain the BH entropy according to the usual thermodynamic formulas. Let us remind the reader how this works for the usual Schwarzschild BH in 3+1 dimensions, see [5]. The Lorentzian signature metric is given by: ds2 = ? parenleftbigg 1? 2GMr parenrightbigg dt2 + dr 2 1? 2GMr +r 2d?2. (1.1) Here M is the BH mass, G is the Newton’s constant, d?2 is the line element on the unit sphere, and t,r are the time and radial coordinates correspondingly. The horizon is located at r = r+ = 2MG. To analytically continue the BH spacetime one sends t ? ?i?. The imaginary time coordinate ? must be periodic with period ? = 1/T, where T is the temperature. The Euclidean metric one gets is: ds2 = parenleftbigg 1? 2GMr parenrightbigg d?2 + dr 2 1? 2GMr +r 2d?2. (1.2) The r,? part of the metric describes a 2-dimensional “plane” with a conical singularity at the origin r = r+. The period of ? must be chosen in such a way that there is no conical singularity. For a metric of the form: ds2 = f(r)d?2 + dr 2 f(r), f(r+) = 0 (1.3) the condition that there is no conical singularity is that the circumference ?radicalbigf?(r+)? of the circle r = r+ + ? is equal to 2? times the proper distance 2??/radicalbigf?(r+) from the origin to the point r = r+ +?. This gives for the period: ? = 4?f?(r +) . (1.4) For Schwarzschild BH f?(r+) = 1/r+ and thetemperature one gets from (1.4) is the famousHawking temperature: TH = 18?GM . (1.5) To obtain the BH partition function one must evaluate the Einstein-Hilbert action: I[g] = ? 116?G integraldisplay M R? 18?G integraldisplay ?M (K ?K0) (1.6) on the metric (1.2). The first term is identically zero on shell. In the second term K is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary, and K0 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary embedded in flat space. We have K ?K0 = ?12f?/f, (1.7) where f = f(r) is as in (1.3). Then, using f? = r+/r2, computing the integral over the boundary and sending r to infinity we get: I[gcl] = 2?r+?8?G = 4?r 2+ 4G . (1.8) The BH partition function is then lnZ = ?I[gcl]. The standard thermodynamic relations tell us that the expectation value of the energy in the system is given by: ?E? = ??lnZ?? . (1.9) It is easy to check that ?E? = M, as expected. The entropy is given by: S = ??? lnZ?? +lnZ. (1.10) The first term here equals twice the quantity (1.8), while the second term is minus (1.8). Therefore, we get for the entropy: S = 4?r 2+ 4G = A 4G, (1.11) where A is the horizon area. This is the famous Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We are going to apply the same strategy to study the thermodynamics of 2+1 dimensional black holes. That is, we are going to analytically continue the BH spacetimes to obtain certain spaces of Euclidean signature. To get the BH partition function we evaluate the gravity action on these spaces. The BH entropy is then obtained according to the standard thermodynamic formulas. The plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section we shall remind the reader some facts about BH in 2+1 dimensions. In section 3 we describe how to analytically continue the BH spacetimes. The BH partition function is discussed in section 4. Finally, we study the BH thermodynamics in 5. We conclude with a short summary. 2 Black Holes in 2+1 dimensions The material reviewed in this section is from [4]. The references for the rotating case are [6, 7]. Black holes in 2+1 dimensions can have non-trivial internal topology. A general BH has g handles hidden behind h horizons. Unlike the case with higher-dimensional black holes, BH’s in 2+1 cannot have more than one horizon per asymptotic region. Thus, the number of horizons is also the number of asymptotic regions. (b)(a) Figure 1: BTZ black hole: the geometry of the time symmetry surface. As the gravity theory in 2+1 dimensions does not have local degrees of freedom, solutions of vacuum Einstein equations are spacetimes of constant curvature. The case relevant to us here is that of negative cosmological constant. Only in this case there are BH’s in the theory. Thus, we have to consider the spacetimes of constant negative curvature. They are all locally indistinguishable from the maximally symmetric spacetime AdS3. All (complete) spacetimes are therefore obtainable by identifications of points in AdS acting by transformations from some discrete group ?, subgroup of the group of isometries. Let us briefly remind the reader some basic facts about the Lorentzian AdS3. The spacetime is best viewed as the interior of an infinite cylinder. The cylinder itself is the conformal boundary I of the spacetime. It is timelike, unlike the null conformal boundary of an asymptotically flat spacetime. All light rays propagating inside AdS start and end on I. In this picture the constant time slices are copies of the Poincare (unit) disk. The unit disk is isometric to the upper half plane U; we shall use both models. The isometry group of the Lorentzian signature AdS3 is SL(2,R)×SL(2,R). The spacetimes itself can be viewed as the SL(2,R) group manifold so that a point x ? AdS3 is represented by a matrix x ? SL(2,R). The isometry group acts by the left and right action: x ? gxh?1,g,h ? SL(2,R). Let us now return to the BH spacetimes. It is easiest to describe non-rotating BH’s. In this case there is a plane of time symmetry X in the spacetime. In order to have such a plane in the quotient spacetime M = AdS3/?, the discrete group ? that one uses to identify points must be such that its action fixes the t = 0 plane in AdS. We use such a parameterization of the SL(2,R) group manifold that the subgroup of isometries that fixes the t = 0 plane is given by: x ? gxgT,g ? SL(2,R). Note that there is another “diagonal” action of the SL(2,R) given by: x ? gxg?1; such transformations fix the origin of AdS. Transformations that fix the t = 0 plane of AdS act on this plane. The geometry of the time symmetry plane X of the quotient spacetime is therefore that of U/?, where U is the hyperbolic plane. Thus, X is a Riemann surface (with holes, see below) uniformized by U. Once the geometry of the time symmetry plane is understood one just “evolves” the identifications in time to obtain the BH spacetime, see [4]. Let us see how this works on examples. Consider first the case of the non-rotating BTZ BH. The corresponding discrete group is generated by a single hyperbolic element. Its action on the t = 0 plane can be understood by finding the so-called fundamental region. The fundamental region D on the hyperbolic plane U for group ? is such that any point on U can be obtained as an image (b)(a) Figure 2: Initial slice geometry of the single asymptotic region black hole with a torus wormhole inside the horizon (b)(a) Figure 3: Initial slice geometry of the three asymptotic region black hole of a point in D under a transformation from ?, and such that no two points of D (except on its boundary) are related. In the case of ? generated by a single element ? the fundamental region is that between two geodesics on U mapped into one another by the generator ?, see Fig. 1(a). It is clear that the quotient space has the topology of the S1 ×R wormhole with two asymptotic regions, each having the topology of S1, see Fig. 1(b). It can also be described as the geometry of a sphere with two holes. On Fig. 1(a) the BTZ angular coordinate runs from one geodesics to the other. The distance between the two geodesics measured along their common normal is precisely the horizon circumference. Evolving the identifications in time one obtains a spacetime of a BH with two asymptotic regions. There are two horizons, they both intersect the time symmetry plane along the minimal length geodesic shown in Fig. 1(b). See [4] for more details on the spacetime picture. Let us now consider more complicated initial slice geometries. We now consider the group ? to be generated by two hyperbolic elements. For example, let the fundamental region be the part of the unit disk between four geodesics, as in Fig. 2(a). Let us identify these geodesics cross-wise. It is straightforward to show that the resulting geometry has only one asymptotic region, consisting of all four parts of the infinity of the fundamental region. With little more effort one can convince oneself that the resulting geometry is one asymptotic region “glued” to a torus, see Fig. 2(b). The spacetime obtained by evolving this geometry is a single asymptotic region black hole, but the topology inside the event horizon is now that of a torus. See [4] for more details on this spacetime. A group generated by two elements can also be used to obtain a three asymptotic region black hole [4]. The fundamental region on the t = 0 plane is again the region bounded by four geodesics.

The developements of the last flve years have opened the possibility to go beyond perturbation theory and to address the most interesting problems of quantum gravity. Among the most prominent 1 of such problems are those related to black holes: the interpretation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, Hawking radiation and the information problem. The present set of lecture notes aims to give a paedagogical introduction to the subject of black holes in supergravity and string theory. It is primarily intended for graduate students who are interested in black hole physics, quantum gravity or string theory. No particular previous knowledge of these subjects is assumed, the notes should be accessible for any reader with some background in general relativity and quantum fleld theory. The basic ideas and techniques are treated in detail, including exercises and their solutions. This includes the deflnitions of mass, surface gravity and entropy of black holes, the laws of black hole mechanics, the interpretation of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole as a supersymmetric soliton, p-brane solutions of higher-dimensional supergravity, their interpretation in string theory and their relation to D-branes, dimensional reduction of supergravity actions, and, flnally, the construction of extreme black holes by dimensional reduction of p-brane conflgurations. Other topics, which are needed to make the lectures self-contained are explained in a summaric way. Busher T-duality is mentioned brie y and studied further in some of the exercises. Many other topics are omitted, according to the motto ’less is more’. A short commented list of references is given at the end of every section. It is not intended to provide a representative or even full account of the literature, but to give suggestions for further reading. Therefore we recommend, based on subjective preference, some books, reviews and research papers. 2 Black holes in Einstein gravity 2.1 Einstein gravity The basic idea of Einstein gravity is that the geometry of space-time is dynamical and is determined by the distribution of matter. Conversely the motion of mat- ter is determined by the space-time geometry: In absence of non-gravitational forces matter moves along geodesics. More precisely space-time is taken to be a (pseudo-) Riemannian manifold with metric g„”. Our choice of signature is (¡+ ++). The reparametrization- invariant properties of the metric are encoded in the Riemann curvature ten- sor R„”‰ , which is related by the gravitational fleld equations to the energy- momentum tensor of matter, T„”. If one restricts the action to be at most quadratic in derivatives, and if one ignores the possibility of a cosmological constant,3 then the unique gravitational action is the Einstein-Hilbert action, SEH = 12•2 Z p ¡gR; (2.1) where • is the gravitational constant, which will be related to Newton’s constant below. The coupling to matter is determined by the principle of minimal cou- 3We will set the cosmological constant to zero throughout. 2 pling, i.e. one replaces partial derivatives by covariant derivatives with respect to the Christofiel connection ¡‰„”.4 The energy-momentum tensor of matter is T„” = ¡2p¡g–SM–g„” ; (2.2) where SM is the matter action. The Euler-Lagrange equations obtained from variation of the combined action SEH +SM with respect to the metric are the Einstein equations R„”¡ 12g„”R = •2T„” : (2.3) Here R„” and R are the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar, respectively. The motion of a massive point particle in a given space-time background is determined by the equation ma” = m_x„r„ _x” = m¡˜x” + ¡”„‰ _x„ _x‰¢ = f” ; (2.4) where a” is the acceleration four-vector, f” is the force four-vector of non- gravitational forces and _x„ = dx„d¿ is the derivative with respect to proper time ¿. In a  at background or in a local inertial frame equation (2.4) reduces to the force law of special relativity, m˜x” = f”. If no (non-gravitational) forces are present, equation (2.4) becomes the geodesic equation, _x„r„ _x” = ˜x” + ¡”„‰ _x„ _x‰ = 0 : (2.5) One can make contact with Newton gravity by considering the Newtonian limit. This is the limit of small curvature and non-relativistic velocities v¿1 (we take c = ~ = 1). Then the metric can be expanded around the Minkowski metric g„” = ·„” + 2ˆ„” ; (2.6) where jˆ„”j¿1. If this expansion is carefully performed in the Einstein equa- tion (2.3) and in the geodesic equation (2.5) one flnds ¢V = 4…GN‰ and d 2~x dt2 =¡ ~rV ; (2.7) where V is the Newtonian potential, ‰ is the matter density, which is the lead- ing part of T00, and GN is Newton’s constant. The proper time ¿ has been eliminated in terms of the coordinate time t = x0. Thus one gets the potential equation for Newton’s gravitational potential and the equation of motion for a point particle in it. The Newtonian potential V and Newton’s constant GN are related to ˆ00 and • by V =¡ˆ00 and •2 = 8…GN : (2.8) 4In the case of fermionic matter one uses the vielbein e a„ instead of the metric and one introduces a second connection, the spin-connection !ab„ , to which the fermions couple. 3

Fisica Chapter 3 Poincar´e gauge theory It is well known that the existence and interaction of certain fields, such as the electromagnetic field, can be closely related to the invariance properties of the theory. Thus, if the Lagrangian of matter fields is invariant under phase transformations with constant parameters ?, the electromagnetic field can be introduced by demanding invariance under extended, local transformations, obtained by replacing ? with a function of spacetime points, ? ? ?(x).This idea was generalized by Yang and Mills (1954) to the case of SU(2) symmetry. Studying these internal local symmetries (appendix A) is particularly interesting from the point of view of the generalization to local spacetime symmetries. On the other hand, it is much less known that Einstein’sGRisinvariant under local Poincar´e transformations. This property is based on the principle of equivalence, and gives a rich physical content to the concept of local or gauge symmetry. Instead of thinking of local Poincar´e symmetry as derived from the principle of equivalence, the whole idea can be reversed, in accordance with the usual philosophy of gauge theories. When the gravitational field is absent, it has become clear from a host of experiments that the underlying symmetry of fundamental interactions is given by the Poincar´e group. If we now want to make a physical theory invariant under local Poincar´e transformations, it is necessary to introduce new, compensating fields, which, in fact, represent gravitational interactions. Compensating fields cancel all the unwanted effects of local transformations and enable the existence of local symmetries. Localization of Poincar´e symmetry leads to the Poincar´e gauge theory of gravity, which contains GR as a special case (Kibble 1961, Sciama 1962). Here, in contrast to GR, at each point of spacetime there exists a whole class of local inertial frames, mutually related by Lorentz transformations. Using this freedom, allowed by the principle of equivalence, we can naturally introduce not only energy–momentum, but also the spin of matter fields into gravitational dynamics. 42 Poincar´e gauge invariance 43 The exposition of Poincar´e gauge theory (PGT) will be followed by the corresponding geometric interpretation, leading to Riemann–Cartan spacetime U 4 . Then, we shall study in more detail two simple but important cases: Einstein– Cartan theory, representing a direct generalization of GR, and teleparallel theory. We shall also give a short account of some general dynamical features of the new gravitational theory. 3.1 Poincar´e gauge invariance We shall now analyse the process of transition from global to local Poincar´e symmetry and find its relation to the gravitational interaction (Kibble 1961). Other spacetime symmetries (de Sitter, conformal, etc) can be treated in an analogous manner. Localization of Poincar´e symmetry We assume that the spacetime has the structure of Minkowski space M 4 . At each point of M 4 , labelled by coordinates x µ , we can define a local Lorentz reference frame, represented by an orthonormal tetrad—a set of four orthonormal, tangent vectors e i (x), e i · e j = ? ij . In global inertial coordinates x µ , we can always choose the tetrad such that it coincides with a coordinate frame e µ (x) (a set of four vectors, tangent to coordinate lines at x), i.e. e i = ? µ i e µ . Here, the Latin indices (i, j,...)refer to local Lorentz frames, while the Greek indices(µ,?,...)refer to coordinate frames. Later, when we come to more general spaces, this distinction will become geometrically more important. A matter field ?(x) in spacetime is always referred to a local Lorentz frame and its transformation law under the Poincar´e group is of the form ? 0 ? = ( 1 2 ?· M +?· P)? = ( 1 2 ?·Sigma1 +? · P) ? C8?. (3.1) The matter Lagrangian C4 M = C4 M (?,? k ?) is assumed to be invariant under global Poincar´e transformations, which yields the conservation of the energy– momentum and angular momentum tensors. If we now generalize Poincar´e transformations by replacing ten constant group parameters with some functions of spacetime points, the invariance condition (2.11) is violated for two reasons. First, the old transformation rule of ? k ?, ? 0 ? k ? = C8? k ? +? k i ? i ? ? C8 k i ? i ? (3.2a) is changed into ? 0 ? k ? = C8? k ? ?? ? ,k ? ? ? + 1 2 ? ij ,k Sigma1 ij ?. (3.2b) The second reason is that ? µ ? µ negationslash= 0. Thus, after using the conservation laws (2.15), we obtain Delta1C4 M = 1 2 ? ij ,µ S µ ij ?(? i ,µ ?? i µ )T µ i negationslash= 0. 44 Poincar´e gauge theory The violation of local invariance can be compensated for by certain modifications of the original theory. Covariant derivative. Let us first eliminate non-invariance stemming from the change in the transformation rule of ? k ?. This can be accomplished by introducing a new Lagrangian C4 prime M = C4 M (?,? k ?) (3.3) where ? k ? is the covariant derivative of ?, which transforms according to the ‘old rule’ (3.2a): ? 0 ? k ? = C8? k ? +? k i ? i ?. (3.4) The new Lagrangian satisfies ?C4 prime M ? ? 0 C4 prime M +? ·?C4 prime M = 0. To show this, we begin by introducing the ?-covariant derivative, which eliminates the ? ij ,µ term in (3.2b): ? µ ? = ? µ ? +? 0 (?)?| ??A µ = (? µ + A µ )? A µ ? 1 2 A ij µ Sigma1 ij (3.5) where ? 0 (?) = ? 0 (?,? = 0) and A ij µ are compensating fields. The condition ? 0 ? µ ? = C8? µ ? ?? ? ,µ ? ? ? (3.6) determines the transformation properties of A µ : ? 0 A µ =[C8, A µ ]?? ? ,µ A ? ?? ,µ ? ? 1 2 ? ij Sigma1 ij ? 0 A ij µ = ? i s A sj µ +? j s A is µ ?? ij ,µ ?? ? ,µ A ij ? ?? ? ? ? A ij µ . (3.7) If we now rewrite equation (3.6) as ? 0 ? µ ? = C8 µ ? ? ? ? ?(? ? ,µ ?? ? µ )? ? ? we see that the last term, which is proportional to ? ? ?, can be eliminated by adding a new compensating field A µ k : ? k ? = ? µ k ? µ ? ? A µ k ? µ ?. (3.8a) Since this expression is homogeneous in ? µ ?, we can introduce the new variables h k µ = ? µ k ? A µ k , and write ? k ? = h k µ ? µ ?. (3.8b) The transformation properties of h k µ follow from equations (3.4) and (3.6): ? 0 h k µ = ? k s h s µ +? µ ,? h k ? ?? ? ? ? h k µ . (3.9) Poincar´e gauge invariance 45 Matter field Lagrangian. Up to now we have found the Lagrangian C4 prime M such that ?C4 prime M = 0. In the second step of restoring local invariance to the theory, we have to take care of the fact that ? µ ? µ negationslash= 0 in (2.11). This is done by multiplying C4 prime M by a suitable function of the fields: tildewide C4 M = Lambda1C4 prime M . (3.10) This expression satisfies the invariance condition (2.11) provided that ? 0 Lambda1+? µ (? µ Lambda1) = 0. Here, coefficients of the local parameters and their derivatives should vanish. Coefficients of the second derivatives of parameters vanish since Lambda1 does not depend on field derivatives, coefficients of ? ? vanish since Lambda1 does not depend explicitly on x, while those of ? ij ,? vanish if Lambda1 is independent of A ij ? .The remaining two conditions are: ? µ ,? : ?Lambda1 ?h k µ h k ? +? ? µ Lambda1 = 0 ? ij : ? ik ?Lambda1 ?h k µ h j µ ?? jk ?Lambda1 ?h k µ h i µ = 0. After multiplying the first equation by b s ? ,theinverseofh k µ , b k µ h k ? = ? ? µ b k µ h s µ = ? k s we easily find a solution for Lambda1: Lambda1 =[det(h k µ )] ?1 = det(b k µ ) ? b. (3.11) The solution is defined up to a multiplicative factor, which is chosen so that Lambda1 ? 1whenh k µ ? ? µ k , and the second equation is automatically satisfied. The final form of the modified Lagrangian for matter fields is tildewide C4 M = bC4 M (?,? k ?). (3.12) It is obtained from the original Lagrangian C4 M (?,? k ?) in two steps: – by replacing ? k ? ?? k ? (the minimal coupling) and – multiplying C4 M by b. The Lagrangian tildewide C4 M satisfies the invariance condition (2.11) by construction, hence it is an invariant density. Example 1. The free scalar field in Minkowski space is given by the Lagrangian C4 S = 1 2 (? kl ? k ?? l ? ? m 2 ? 2 ). Localization of Poincar´e symmetry leads to tildewide C4 S = 1 2 b(? kl ? k ?? l ? ? m 2 ? 2 ) = 1 2 b(g µ? ? µ ?? ? ? ? m 2 ? 2 ) 46 Poincar´e gauge theory where g µ? = ? kl h k µ h l ? and ? k ? = h k µ ? µ ?. Similarly, the Dirac LagrangianC4 D = 1 2 (i ¯ ?? k ? ? k ? ? 2m ¯ ??)becomes tildewide C4 D = 1 2 b(i ¯ ?? k ? ? k ? ? 2m ¯ ??) ? ? k ?? ? k ?? ? k where ? k ? = h k µ (? µ + A µ )?, ? k ¯ ? = ¯ ?(? ? µ ? A µ )h k µ , A µ ? 1 2 A ij µ ? ij . Comments. After localizing the Poincar´e transformations, we could think that the Lorentz part can be absorbed into ? µ (x), and lose its independence. However, field transformation law (3.1) shows that the Lorentz part preserves its independence. The form of transformation law (3.1) motivates us to ask whether we can treat ? µ and ? ij , instead of ? µ and ? µ? ,asindependent parameters. In the case of global Poincar´e transformations this is not possible; for instance, the transformation defined by ? µ = 0, ? ij negationslash= 0 is not an allowed one. When the symmetry is localized, the answer to this question is affirmative, due to the transformation laws of compensating fields. When we go from global to local Poincar´e group, the translation generator P i =?? i should be replaced with ˜ P i =?? i . The group of local Lorentz rotations and local translations has a more general structure than the original Poincar´e group, as can be seen from the commutation relations of the new generators. In order to have a clear geometric interpretation of the local transformations, it is convenient to generalize our previous convention concerning the use of Latin and Greek indices. According to transformation rules (3.7) and (3.9), the use of indices in A ij µ and h k µ is in agreement with this convention: these fields transform as local Lorentz tensors with respect to Latin indices and as world (coordinate) tensors with respect to Greek indices. We can also check that local Lorentz tensors can be transformed into world tensors and vice versa, by multiplication with h k µ or b k µ .Theterm?? ij ,µ in (3.7) shows that A ij µ is a potential (an analogous term appears in ? 0 A µ k ). The explicit form of the spin matrix Sigma1 ij , appearing in ? µ ?, depends only on the Lorentz transformation properties of ?. It is, therefore, natural to extend the ?-covariant derivative? µ to any quantity transforming linearly under Lorentz transformations, ignoring its ? transformations. Thus, for instance, ? µ h k ? =[? µ + 1 2 A ij µ (Sigma1 1 ij )] k s h s ? = ? µ h k ? ? A s kµ h s ? ? µ H kl =[? µ + 1 2 A ij µ (Sigma1 2 ij )] kl rs H rs = ? µ H kl + A k sµ H sl + A l sµ H ks where Sigma1 1 ij and Sigma1 2 ij are the vector and tensor representations of Sigma1 ij : (Sigma1 1 ij ) k s = (? k i ? js ?? k j ? is ) (Sigma1 2 ij ) kl rs = (Sigma1 1 ij ) k r ? l s +(Sigma1 1 ij ) l s ? k r .

The aim is not that of give a complete and exhaustive treatment of canonical transformations from a mathematical point of view. Rather, we will try to show, through some concrete examples, the physical relevance of these transformations in the framework of QFT. This relevance is on two levels: a formal one, in which canonical transformations are an im- portant tool for the understanding of basic aspects of QFT, such as the existence of inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations (see x1.2) or the way in which symmetry breaking occurs, through a (homogeneous or non-homogeneous) condensation mechanism (see Section 4), On the other hand, they are also useful in the study of specific physical problems, like the superconductivity (see x2.2) or the field mixing (see Section 5). In the next we will restrict our attention to two specific (linear) canonical transformations: the Bogoliubov rotation and the boson translation. The reason for studying these two particular transformations is that they are of crucial importance in QFT, where they are associated to various condensation phenomena. The plan of the lectures is the following: in Section 1 we review briefly canonical transfor- mations in classical and Quantum Mechanics (QM) and then we discuss some general features of QFT, showing that there canonical transformations can have non-trivial meaning, whereas in QM they do not affect the physical level. In Section 2 and 3 we consider some specific prob- lems as examples: superconductivity, QFT at finite temperature, the quantization of a simple dissipative system and the quantization of a boson field on a curved background. In all of these subjects, the ideas and the mathematical tools presented in Section 1 are applied. In Section 4 we show the connection between spontaneous symmetry breakdown and boson translation. We also show by means of an example, how macroscopic (topological) object can arise in QFT, when suitable canonical transformations are performed. Finally, Section 5 is devoted to the detailed study of the field mixing, both in the fermion and in the boson case. As an application, neutrino oscillations are discussed. 1 Section 1 Canonical transformations in Quantum Field Theory 1.1 Canonical transformations in Classical and Quantum Mechanics Let us consider[1, 2] a system described by n independent coordinates (q1;:::;qn) together with their conjugate momenta (p1;:::;pn). The Hamilton equations are ?qi = @H@p i ; ?pi = ¡@H@q i (1.1) By introducing a 2n-dimensional phase space with coordinate variables (·1;:::;·n;·n+1;:::;·2n) = (q1;:::;qn;p1;:::;pn) (1.2) the Hamilton equations are rewritten as ?·i = Jij @H@· j (1.3) where Jij is a 2n£2n matrix of the form J = ˆ 0 I ¡I 0 !

Fisica Bounding the speed of ‘spooky action at a distance’ Juan Yin, Yuan Cao, Hai-Lin Yong, Ji-Gang Ren, Hao Liang, Sheng-Kai Liao, Fei Zhou, Chang Liu, Yu-Ping Wu, Ge-Sheng Pan, Qiang Zhang, Cheng-Zhi Peng and Jian-Wei Pan1 1Shanghai Branch, National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Shanghai 201315, China Abstract In the well-known EPR paper, Einstein et al. called the nonlocal correlation in quantum en- tanglement as ‘spooky action at a distance’. If the spooky action does exist, what is its speed? All previous experiments along this direction have locality loopholes and thus can be explained without having to invoke any ‘spooky action’ at all. Here, we strictly closed the locality loopholes by observing a 12-hour continuous violation of Bell inequality and concluded that the lower bound speed of ‘spooky action’ was four orders of magnitude of the speed of light if the Earth’s speed in any inertial reference frame was less than 10 3 times of the speed of light. 1 In order to test the speed of ‘spooky action at a distance’[1], Eberhard proposed[2] a 12- hour continuous space-like Bell inequality [3, 4] measurement over a long east-west oriented distance. Bene ted from the Earth self rotation, the measurement would be ergodic over all possible translation frames and as a result, the bound of the speed would be universal[2, 5] . Salart et al.[5] recently claimed to have achieved the lower bound of ‘spooky action’ through an experiment using Eberhard’s proposal. In that experiment, time-bin entan- gled photon pairs were distributed over two sites, both equipped with a Franson-type interferometer[6] to analyze the photon pairs. At one site, the phase of the interferome- ter was kept stable and the phase of the interferometer at the other site was continuously scanned. An interference fringe of 87.6% was achieved, which was claimed to be a Bell test by the authors. However any bipartite Bell test requires at least two settings at each site because if there was only one setting, one could always achieve the same interference fringe with a product state without any entanglement. Moreover, as pointed out by Ko er et al.[7], even if the phase of the  rst site had a second setting, the experiment still had locality loop- hole, because the setting choice on one site could not be space-like separated from either the measurement events at the other site or the entanglement source generation event[8{10]. Due to these loopholes, the experiment could be explained by common causes[7] instead of ‘spook action’. Actually, similar loopholes existed in all previous attempts for the speed measurement of ‘spooky action’[11{13]. Here, we distributed entangled photon pairs over two site that were 16-km apart sites via free space optical link and implemented a space-like Bell test [3, 4] to close the locality loophole. Meanwhile, we utilized fast electro optic modulators (EOMs) to address the freedom-of-choice loophole. Our two sites are east-west oriented sites at the same latitude as Eberhard proposed[2]. Suppose two events occur in the two sites, respectively at positions ~rA and ~rB at time tA and tB under an inertial reference frame centered on the Earth and given another inertial reference frame L, moving with a speed  ~ relatively to the Earth center frame, the two events’ coordinates are ( ~rA0;t0A) and ( ~rB0;t0B). When Bell inequality violation is observed with the two events in frame L, the speed of ‘spooky action’ Vsa has a lower bound shown as below: Vsa k ~rB 0 ~r A 0k jt0B t0Aj (1) 2 Under the Earth-centered inertial coordinate frame, the lower bound is obtained by Lorentz transformation as follow: (Vsac )2 1 + (1   2)(1  2) ( +j ==j)2 (2) where, c is the speed of light;  = c jtB tAj=k ~rB0 ~rA0k is a factor of alignment of the two events in Earth center frame;  =j~ j=c is the Earth center’s relative speed in the L frame and  == =j~ ==j=c with ~ == the component of ~ parallel to the A-B axis. Due to the Earth self rotation,  and  == are time dependent. Suppose the angle between A-B axis and Earth center frame’s X-Y axis is  , the angle between ~ and Earth center frame’s Z axis is  and ! is the angular velocity of the Earth, we have:  ==(t) =  cos sin + sin cos cos!t (3) When A-B axis is exactly east-west oriented,  = 0 and equation (3) is simpli ed into:  ==(t) =  sin cos!t (4) If we choose the measuring period T to meet !T  1, there always has a time t in the period to satisfy j ==j j sin  !T=2j. Therefore we achieve the optimal lower bound for Vsa, which is: (Vsac )2 1 + (1   2)(1  2) ( +j sin  !T=2j)2 (5) Fig.1 was the setup of the whole experiment. We, at the sending site, prepared and distributed entangled photon pairs to two receiving sites through two refractor telescopes respectively. As was shown in Fig. 1a., all the sites were located at the Qinghai Lake region, Qinghai Province, P. R. China. The two receiving site were east-west oriented and separated with a 15.3 km distance. One was a scenery view point (36 33015.3100N, 100 28024.6600E) and the other was a  shing farm (36 33015.3100N, 100 38042.0000E). The sending site(36 32025.2200N, 100 33033.3000E) was in the middle of the two receiving sites. At the sending site, we generated polarization entangled photon pairs via type II sponta- neous parametric down conversion (SPDC)[14] in a periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) crystal. In Fig. 1b., a single-longitudinal-mode ultraviolet semiconductor laser (405nm) was 3 45 linearly polarized by a half wave plate (HWP) and a quarter wave plate (QWP) and then splited into two beams by a polarization beam splitter (PBS). After passing through the PPKTP crystal placed in the center of the Sagnac interferometer[15], the photon pairs generated by SPDC from opposite directions interfered at the same PBS and formed the polarization entanglement. The photon pairs were in the two-particle singlet state, i.e. j  i= (jHiAjViB jViAjHiB)=p2. Under a 12.4 mW pump power, we achieved 550 KHz coincidence rates with 3-nanosecond coincidence window. The visibility was better than 91.3%(accidental counts not subtracted). The PPKTP crystal was set at its degenerate temperature by a thermoelectric cooling (TEC) temperature controller and both converted photon pairs were at the degenerate wavelength 811.54 nm. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the photon pairs’ spectral linewidth was 0.6 nm , which was decided by phase- matching condition of the SPDC process. Finally, the entangled photon pairs were coupled into single mode  bers (SMFs) and led to the integrated sending system, which consisted of an 80-mm f/7(that is, aperture 80mm, focal length 560mm) extra-low dispersion apoc- hromatic refractor telescope, a dichroic mirror (DM) and a piezo-driven fast steering mirror (FSM). The divergence of our compact quantum transmitter was about 30  rad. The distributed entangled photons were collected by receiving telescopes and delivered to polarization analyzing units at both receiving sites. In each of the unit (Fig. 1c), a random number controlled EOM combined with a PBS was applied to actively choose the measuring base of the Bell inequality. The outputs of the PBS were coupled into two 105  m core diameter, multi-mode  bers through aspherical lens, and thereafter detected by the single- photon counting modules (SPCMs), respectively. The detection signals from SPCMs were encoded with the controlled signals applied in EOMs as the output ones. As was described before, in order to be ergodic all possible inertial reference frame, a continuous 12-hour Bell inequality measurement was necessary. However, the shaking of the whole system and the atmosphere turbulence in uenced the telescope optical link. In previous experiments[16, 17], the free space optical link would lose after at most ten- minute continuous measurement, which was de nitely not long enough for our experiment. Therefore, we developed laser assisted free space tracking techniques as shown in Fig. 1a. We sent a green lasers light (532 nm, 100 mw, 1.5 mrad) from sending site to the two receiving sites, respectively as the tracking signal. Meanwhile, in both receiving sites, we sent a red laser light (671 nm, 100 mw, 1.5 mrad) back to the sending site. All lasers were 4 sent co-axially with the entangled photon pairs. In each sending or receiving site, we utilized a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) camera to detect the 532 nm laser signal and a two-dimensional rotatable platform in both azimuth and elevation to track, which constituted a closed loop coarse tracking system. The bandwidth of coarse tracking system was about 10 Hz, which was decided by the read-out time of the camera. The slow response time of the system could not keep the free space optical link if some sudden change, for example the atmosphere turbulence, happened in the channel. In order to increase the tracking system’s bandwidth, we adopted a  ne tracking system in each sending telescope. The  ne tracking system was composed of a four-quadrant detector(QD), a piezo-driven FSM and a DM. The tracking light (671 nm) from the receiving site, was collected by the sending telescope and then re ected by the FSM into the DM. The DM transmitted the entangled photons and re ected the tracking light into the QD. The QD’s detection information would feedback to the FSM to make a close loop. Then thus, we achieved the tracking accuracy better than 3.5  rad with more than 150 Hz bandwidth and the continuous measurement time extended beyond 12 hours. In order to satisfy the space-like criteria, we needed to strictly time tag all the events during the measurement. In the experiment, we utilized laser synchronization technology. In the sending site, we split and sent co-axially with the entangled photons, a near infrared pulse laser (1064 nm, 5 kHz, 10 mw, 200  rad) to two receiving sites as the synchronization signal. The signals were detected by high-speed avalanche photo diodes. Meanwhile, both receiving sites had GPS (Global Position System) for the system’s initial synchronization and rough timing adjustment. Both sites utilized time to digital converters (TDC) to record the detection signals, synchronization signals and GPS signals. Therefore, we achieved a timing accuracy better than 1 ns. Fig. 2 was the space-time diagram of the experiment. We set the entangled photon pairs generation as the original point of the space-time diagram. The points A (-8 km, 25.6  s) and B (8 km, 25.6  s) represented the measurements in receiving site A and B, respectively. By adjusting the  ber length at the sending site, we distributed the entangled photon pairs to both receiving sites almost at the same time. The overall timing uncertainty between A and B was 350 ps (corresponding to a distance of 105mm), which was decided by the timing jitter of the detectors and TDCs. The time di erence between A and B events was far less than their space distance. So the two measurement events A and B were space-like separate. 5

Molecular biology has had  equally epoch-making successes unravelling the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying living  systems, from the genetic code through to developmental structures such as homeotic genes. Despite  these conceptual advances, the principles by which the brain generates mind remain mysterious. The  intractability of this central unresolved problem in science suggests its principles run deeper than the  conventional biochemical description, requiring novel biophysical principles. This paper develops such a  model based on linkage between the fractal aspect of chaotic neurodynamics and quantum non-locality,  giving brain science a cosmological status at the foundations of physical description. 1.2 Chaos and Quantum Mechanics : Unpredictability as a Basis for Mind Although mechanists tolerate  mind as a passive shadow representation of physical causality in such theories as epiphenomenalism and  brain-mind identity, free-will conjures up the spectre of active causal interference. To quote Sir John  Eccles :'It is a psychological fact that we believe we have the ability to control and modify our actions  by the exercise of "will", and in practical life all sane men will assume they have this ability'.  Nevertheless free will has a very unpopular history in science because of the paradox of mind acting on  a supposedly deterministic physical system. The controversiality of consciousness and free-will in  science stems from their supposed inconsistency with causal scientific description - but is this so?  Chaotic dynamical systems and quantum mechanics both share attributes which are more consistent with  these two features than biochemical reductionism would suggest: 1.2.1 Chaotic dynamics possess both sensitivity to initial conditions and computational unpredictability,  fig 1(a) (Schuster 1986, Stewart 1989) because exponential spreading of adjacent trajectories with  increasing time occurs with a positive Liapunov exponent L > 1 fig 1(a). Similar considerations apply to  complex systems in transition in and out of chaotic regimes, where L crosses 1 . Arbitrarily small  fluctuations are thus inflated into global instabilities by the "butterfly effect", in which a perturbation  such as a butterfly can become the source of a subsequent tropical cyclone. A chaotic system is  arbitrarily sensitive to perturbation and hence responsive. Sensitivity also prevents a chaotic system  from being precisely modelled. It is thus unpredictable, though it may be deterministic. Such systems  behave in a way which makes it impossible for an observer outside the system to describe it precisely  enough to determine its outcome and hence test its causal nature. 1.2.2 Quanta possess a global internal model of their environment in the form of the wave function and  violate causality through uncertainty during reduction of the wave packet. These attributes, although  somewhat different in nature from sensitivity and unpredictability, cap off the causality of chaotic  physical systems at the microscopic level and have parallels to consciousness and free-will. Although a  quantum behaves like a particle in terms of its emission and absorption, its wave function extends  throughout space-time, forming a global representation of its environment. Subsequent absorption of the  particle appears to collapse the wave function into only one of its superposition of possible states. Thus  although averaged ensembles of events conform to the probability distribution of the wave, the  absorption foci of individual quanta cannot be predicted. The stochastic nature of the theory makes it  possible in effect for each quantum to both be conscious of the universe through the extended wave  file:///C|/Documents and Settings/hasi•i/Dokumenty/Mar•an...lassic eBooks/Science/Brain, Chaos, Quantum Mechanics.txt (1 of 26)16.11.2003 12:42:06 file:///C|/Documents and Settings/hasi•i/Dokumenty/Mar•anovi ptá•koviny/k..., Fantasy, and Classic eBooks/Science/Brain, Chaos, Quantum Mechanics.txt function and to exercise free-will in its demise in wave packet reduction, while conforming to the  principles of quantum mechanics. 1.2.3 Fractal linkage. These two levels of physics have a natural link of scale through the fractal nature  of chaotic dynamics. Many chaotic systems display conserved sets such as attractors and basins which  are fractal in the sense that they are replicatively self-similar on descending microscopic scales, resulting  in a non-integer dimensionality (Peitgen & Richter 1986). In fig 1(b) the Koch flake illustrates a simple  geometrical fractal in which each side is repeatedly replaced by 4 sides of 1/3 the length l. The number  of units thus scales as l -log4/log3, giving a fractal dimension D = log4/log3. The correlation dimension  is a similar measure (Grassberger & Procaccia 1983). The term quantum chaos has been used to describe a variety of quantum systems which have analogous  dynamics to classically chaotic systems. Electrons, atoms and small molecules traversing a molecular  milieu, have dynamics well approximated by a chaotic system. Complementing this frontier is the link  between quantum uncertainty and sensitive dependence. In a chaotic physical system, quantum  fluctuations will become amplified into global instabilities by the butterfly effect - quantum inflation.  The fractal nature of chaotic dynamics results in a disseminated set of increasingly unstable regimes  which can serve as nuclei for global fluctuation (King 1991). Complex systems in the chaotic transition  region may also enter a state of self-organized criticality in which a local perturbation leads to global  bifurcation. Although our sensory experiences, particularly visual representations of the physical world, have  obvious stability properties, the necessity of sensitive dependence on the external world guarantees that  the internal model must include unstable dynamics, as is confirmed by study of optical illusions,  hallucinations and dreams. Recent studies of the chaotic dynamics of a variety of neurophysiological  processes support such attractor-bifurcation models at both the cellular and neurosystems level. 1.2.4 The Mind of the Uncertain Brain Such a linkage could be used by the brain to allows mind states  to critically perturb brain states through quantum non-locality. Such an interaction is possible only if the  time evolution of the brain is formally unpredictable when observed externally as a physical system.  This unpredictability must also be advantageous in evolutionary terms, and hence must assist the brain  in the computationally intractable task of survival in the open environment. In this sense, mind may be  an extra-physical dual aspect of reality, corresponding to unpredictabilities and uncertainties in a  physical brain. Such an interpretation is a dual model of reality in which mental and physical are  fundamental components of the universe. The physical world is manifest only indirectly as a set of  stability properties of mind. From the physical perspective the same mental experiences correspond to  stability structures in an internal model of reality. 2 Conceptual Problems in the Mind-Brain Relationship 2.1 Defining Mind and Consciousness 2.1.1 Mind and Consciousness remain so different from the usual objects of scientific inquiry that it is  unclear they conform to the objective criteria usually applied to scientific description. The terms are the  subject of such ambiguity that it is essential to review their semantic variations: Mind is often referred to as the sum of our intellectual faculties, our capacity to think or reason, the  rational mind, as distinct from sensation. Being out of one's mind in a complementary way suggests  escape from rational controls into insanity. Mindless activity similarly implies unreflecting action.  Minding carries different emphases of attending - "Mind that step!" or caring - "I don't mind if I do!".  Being mindful again implies attentiveness. Having something on one's mind that of preoccupied  file:///C|/Documents and Settings/hasi•i/Dokumenty/Mar•an...lassic eBooks/Science/Brain, Chaos, Quantum Mechanics.txt (2 of 26)16.11.2003 12:42:06 file:///C|/Documents and Settings/hasi•i/Dokumenty/Mar•anovi ptá•koviny/k..., Fantasy, and Classic eBooks/Science/Brain, Chaos, Quantum Mechanics.txt thought. Making up one's mind that of deciding. Being of one mind having the same opinion or intent.  Nevertheless, mind as the dual of body embraces the diversity of subjective experience. To avoid such  semantic confusion, I will inclusively define mind as: the envelope of all subjective manifestations of  brain-related activity, including sensation, thought, feeling and states such as dreaming. The essential  feature of the mental is its fundamentality, the fact that all our access to the physical world occurs via  the conduit of subjective experience, the one undeniable reality of existence. Two scientifically controversial attributes of mind are likely to be pivotal to a successful description : 2.1.1.1 Consciousness : subjective manifestation of attentive brain function. 2.1.1.2 Free-will : mental action upon brain function, violating physical determinism. At a primary level, our conscious experiences are our only access to the nature of physical reality.  Although we become firmly convinced of the existence of the real world, our access to this world is only  by inference from our subjective, conscious experience as observers. The physical universe is manifest  entirely as structural stabilities of conscious experience, or as conceptual descriptions we develop from  analysis of other forms of conscious observation, such as particle tracks, spectrographs etc. The physical  world is thus accessed indirectly as an inferential structure linking our own conscious experiences and  those of others into a single stable description. Thus despite believing in the primacy of the world we  live in, all of us derive all our knowledge of the universe from our subjective representations of reality  (Eccles 1966, Blakemore & Greenfield, 1987, Rose 1973, Margenau 1984). Without the direct avenue of  subjective awareness, it is unclear that a physical universe would even exist. This basic and undeniable manifestation of subjective consciousness has again a backdrop of other more  restrictive concepts. One can refer to another person as conscious or unconscious depending on whether  they appear to be responding to stimuli, or in a state of coma. One can also compare the conscious with  the subconscious or the collective unconscious of Jung, allowing for some attributes of mind to pass  subliminally into existence or represent archetypes lying below the level of attentive awareness.  Cognitive scientists may dismiss many peripheral aspects of brain processing as being pre-conscious,  leaving only the major orienting focus of attention as reaching the conscious level. Finally consciousness  is viewed as a reflective type of attention process, exemplified by self-consciousness in which a person  in addition to perceiving is aware of themselves as a subject. As described by Rosenthal (1986) "a  conscious state is one which has a higher-order accompanying thought which is about the state in  question". Ironically such self-consciousness has been claimed by Jaynes (1976) to be a very recent and  culture-born imposition, however to the contrary, it may be an evolutionary feature of mammalian or  even metazoan brains, because distinction of self from world is the fundamental distinction for survival.  A central feature of consciousness research is how perception and attention combine to result in action  in the brain (and mind). I will thus inclusively define consciousness as: the envelope of capacities of the brain to form subjective  representations of reality. In this sense, the brain is conscious of mind. This is consistent with one of the  most popular modern conceptions of the mind as an internal model of reality constructed by the brain, a  view consistent with a variety of lines of evidence spanning normal cognition, the nature of optical  illusions, dreaming and many pathological states of the brain. Free-will on the other hand is the  reciprocal action of mind on brain. 2.1.2 The Menagerie of the Mind The scope of subjective experience can be outlined through a  combination of introspection and study of traditional concepts in language. The most undeniable mental  experiences are our sensory experiences of the world around us, and physical sensations in our bodies  file:///C|/Documents and Settings/hasi•i/Dokumenty/Mar•an...lassic eBooks/Science/Brain, Chaos, Quantum Mechanics.txt (3 of 26)16.11.2003 12:42:06 file:///C|/Documents and Settings/hasi•i/Dokumenty/Mar•anovi ptá•koviny/k..., Fantasy, and Classic eBooks/Science/Brain, Chaos, Quantum Mechanics.txt from touch and pain through to the manifestations of emotions such as fear and anger. Along with these  come less clearly defined inner images provided by memorization, imagination and thought. While these  are less rich than direct sensory experience in usual waking life, probably as a result of competition with  direct sensory stimuli accessing the same processing modules, in states of relaxation, sensory-deprival,  dreaming, or meditation, internal imagery becomes clearer and less distinguishable in intensity from  sensory experience, and may take on a life of its own. Study of the properties of such alternative states  has immense potential for consciousness research, because the properties of consciousness are not  sensorily tied to the physical world description, thus providing a unique opportunity to test its internal  dynamical qualities. Many mental features, being processes rather than states, cannot be subjected to stable scrutiny without  changing their characteristics. While it is easy to understand the meaning of this sentence, it is vastly  more difficult to simultaneously perceive the details of how you are able to understand its meaning, and  more difficult still to decide to what extent the semantic background of the words is consciously  perceived or merely subconsciously controlling the conceptual process. Nevertheless it is accepted  English usage that we can choose to think and that thinking is a structured conscious process, in which a  sequence of semantic concepts emerge as a product of directed voluntary attention, a sequential process  with semantic direction, which may take the form of narrative, rehearsal or have sensory or abstract  properties. To imagine is again a voluntary process but dealing with imagery generation. By contrast, to  have an idea is a spontaneous and possibly novel product of the thought process. Such terminology is  consistent with a dynamical model in which the attention process generates structural bifurcations, some  of which spontaneously generate novel features or concepts. The difficulty of attending to two things at  once and the singularity of the stream of consciousness suggests that it represents a global dynamic in  the brain. It may be more accurately described as a bundle of related awarenesses, dynamically coupled,  but capable of further bifurcation. Central to our subjective consciousness is the notion of an observer, or self, witnessing a theatre of  conscious experience through the attention process, having the capacity by an act of will, or intent, to  alter the circumstances occurring in the perceived world. Dennet (1991), based on the dictates of a  parallel processing model, and various perceptual illusions, asserts that such a "Cartesian Theatre" is  non-existent. "What would make this sequence the stream of consciousness? There is no one inside ,  looking at the wide screen show displayed all over the cortex, even if such a show is discernible by  outside observers". Nevertheless the construction of the physical world model is derived from our  conscious experiences. While there may not be a localized and distinct representation of the stream of  consciousness in the brain, and consciousness, including time-perception, may present as an internal  model of reality, the self and its intentional relation to the stream of consciousness remains our  fundamental arena of experiential reality. 2.1.3 Observer Problems in Consciousness Several features make consciousness uniquely difficult to  observe: 2.1.3.1 Mental observation [introspection] involves a whole-systems observer problem in which the  system being observed is also the system doing the observing. "Introspection is one of the many forms  consciousness itself can assume, so that it represents a significant part of what we are trying to  explain" (Miller 1992). The attempt to examine conscious states thus globally alters their  phenomenology. 2.1.3.2 Mental constructs do not satisfy the criteria of objectivity possessed by physical objects and  file:///C|/Documents and Settings/hasi•i/Dokumenty/Mar•an...lassic eBooks/Science/Brain, Chaos, Quantum Mechanics.txt (4 of 26)16.11.2003 12:42:06 file:///C|/Documents and Settings/hasi•i/Dokumenty/Mar•anovi ptá•koviny/k..., Fantasy, and Classic eBooks/Science/Brain, Chaos, Quantum Mechanics.txt processes, so most aspects objective observation are rendered invalid. "Although consciousness exists by  virtue of some physical property of the brain, just as bioluminescence exists by virtue of some chemical  property of specialized cells, it is not as bioluminescence is an observable property of living matter. Nor  is it an invisible property... It is detectible to anyone who has it. The difficulty is the method by which  consciousness is detected is logically different from ... bioluminescence" (Miller 1992). Thus qualia  such as redness remain ill-defined. 2.1.3.3 As William James originally pointed out "consciousness is not a thing, but a process". Conscious  features may thus be rapidly transformed by the very act of observation, leaving only the sensoria as  stable observables. Thought is an example of such dynamically unstable observation, because the act of  thinking results in an evolution of the experience. An idea is an unstable bifurcation to a novel thought  state. 2.1.3.4 The boundary between subconscious processing and conscious experience is ill-defined.  Consciousness may thus be incomplete as a process. The hidden background of conscious experience,  which Dreyfus and Searle call "intrinsic intentionality" may contain some of the highest computations. 2.1.3.5 Crick & Koch (1992) note that the problem of consciousness is ill posed, because it is a  constructive process, requiring further constraints to provide a unique solution. 2.1.3.6 The subjective experience of free-will is inconsistent with causal description. 2.2 Concepts of the Brain-Mind Relationship A diverse variety of views of the mind-brain relationship have been advanced, providing pointers to the  basis of mind in brain function, while confirming the unresolved state of understanding in this area. 2.2.1 Complexity : Consciousness as a property of complex computational systems. One common idea  about the emergence of mind is that it is somehow a product of the very complexity of the brain.  However neither computer circuits nor artificial neural nets are ascribed to possess the attribute of mind  in addition to their functioning at any given level of numerical complexity. John Searle (1980) invented the Chinese room, in which [conscious] operators translate Chinese by  symbolic constructs without the system being conscious of the meaning of the translation, to point out  that strong AI cannot by itself explain consciousness. Dennett (1991) utters the 'systems reply' against  this by saying that the brain is complex and is conscious so it is possible in principle for a parallel virtual  machine to become conscious through it's many parallel interactions - "this little bit of brain activity  doesn't understand Chinese, and neither does this bigger bit of which it is a part ... even the activity of  the whole brain is insufficient to account for understanding Chinese"... of course the dualists would say  "it takes an immaterial soul to pull off the miracle of understanding". Dennet's critical untested  assumption is that the brain is simply a classical virtual machine. Measures of complexity based only on neural net architecture neglect non-trivial properties of the  individual neuron. The coelenterate Hydra, fig 2, displays complex behaviour involving a greater variety  of locomotion types than the sea snail Aplysia and coordinated feeding, despite having an  undifferentiated nerve net, which can withstand migratory reintegrations of the ectoderm and endoderm  if the organism is turned inside out. Certain non-linear systems near the chaotic boundary L ~ 1 or in chaotic transition do however display  complex bifurcations and the development of novel structure within the system, and for this reason are  termed complex systems by the Santa Fe school (Jen 1990). These form good models for  neurophysiology, and have the potential when given an adequate quantum foundation also to explain  consciousness. file:///C|/Documents and Settings/hasi•i/Dokumenty/Mar•an...lassic eBooks/Science/Brain, Chaos, Quantum Mechanics.txt (5 of 26)16.11.2003 12:42:06 
Fisica gr-qc/9601010   9 Jan 1996 The Evolution of Distorted Rotating Black Holes III: Initial Data Steven R. Brandt (1;2) and Edward Seidel (1;2) (1) National Center for Supercomputing Applications 605 E. Spring eld Ave., Champaign, Il. 61820 (2) Department of Physics University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (October 7, 1997) In this paper we study a new family of black hole initial data sets corresponding to distorted \Kerr" black holes with moderate rotation parameters, and distorted Schwarzschild black holes with even- and odd-parity radiation. These data sets build on the earlier rotating black holes of Bowen and York and the distorted Brill wave plus black hole data sets. We describe the construction of this large family of rotating black holes. We present a systematic study of important properties of these data sets, such as the size and shape of their apparent horizons, and the maximum amount of radiation that can leave the system during evolution. These data sets should be a very useful starting point for studying the evolution of highly dynamical black holes and can easily be extended to 3D. PACS numbers: 95.30.Sf, 04.25.Dm, 04.30.+x I. INTRODUCTION There is increasing interest in the study of black holes from both astrophysical and theoretical points of view. Coalescing black hole binaries are considered an important source of gravitational waves for LIGO [1], VIRGO [2] and other gravitational wave observatories. At the same time, numerical studies of black holes are advancing to the point where highly distorted, axisym- metric black holes [3,4] and black hole collisions [5,6] can be simulated, extracting important physics such as the gravitational wave forms emitted and the dynamics and properties of the event and apparent horizons [7,8]. Re- cent progress has also been made in 3D [9] black hole spacetimes. These are some of the reasons it is impor- tant to develop a series of initial data sets to evolve. However, black hole initial data sets are interesting in their own right, apart from evolutions. They are poten- tially useful for studying problems related to cosmic cen- sorship, such as the Penrose inequality [10]. Furthermore, it is possible to study greater numbers of data sets with higher resolution than is practical to evolve numerically. This can lead to important observations of properties of apparent horizons and can help to identify particularly interesting spacetimes for evolution studies. Initial data sets of the type described in this paper can be used to analyze the most extreme types of distortion and may have bearing on the hoop conjecture [11,12]. The study of an apparent horizon in an initial data set may pro- vide valuable insight into which spacetimes might have the most distorted event horizons. Black hole initial data sets, based on the Einstein- Rosen bridge construction [13], have been developed over the last few decades. In the early 1960’s a series of time symmetric, conformally  at wormhole data sets cor- responding to two black holes were developed by Mis- ner [14] and Brill and Lindquist [15]. At about the same time Brill developed an initial data set for gravitational wave spacetimes that involved specifying a free function in the conformal part of the 3{metric that determined the distribution of the gravitational wave energy in the spacetime [16]. These time symmetric initial data sets were combined to produce the NCSA \Brill wave plus black hole" spacetimes, generalizing the single wormhole to a highly distorted black hole spacetime [10,17]. The evolution of these data sets has been very useful in un- derstanding the dynamics of highly distorted black hole spacetimes, and also in preparing for studies of collid- ing black holes, as colliding holes form a highly distorted single hole immediately after the merging process. Rotat- ing, stationary black hole data sets, which are not time- symmetric, were  rst discovered by Kerr [18] in 1963, and then a nonstationary form was discovered by Bowen and York [19]. The conformally  at Bowen and York con- struction for single black holes was then generalized to multiple conformally  at holes with angular momentum by a number of authors (for example, see [20]) leading to recently computed 3D data sets for two black holes with arbitrary spin and angular momentum [21]. In this paper we discuss a new family of distorted ro- tating black hole initial data sets, some of which were evolved and studied in Ref. [22,23,24]. Although the constructions we present here are axisymmetric, our ap- proach is easily carried out in 3D. These data sets com- bine a number of the ideas discussed above, generalizing the Bowen and York construction by including a \Brill wave" so that highly distorted, rotating black holes with gravitational radiation can be studied. In addition to these new data sets to be described below, this family in- cludes as special cases all previous single black hole data sets discussed above, including the Schwarzschild, Kerr, Bowen and York, and NCSA \Brill wave plus black hole" spacetimes. As we have shown in Ref. [7,23,25], these data sets are interesting in their own right as dynamical black holes. These black holes radiate both polarizations of the grav- itational wave  eld, and their horizon geometries can be 1 so distorted they cannot be embedded in a  at Euclidean space. In future papers we will continue to explore their dynamics in detail. Moreover, just as in the non-rotating case, these data sets can be used to understand the late time behavior of coalescing, multiple black hole systems, as highly distorted \Kerr" black holes will be formed in the process. These data sets can be thought of as repre- senting initial conditions for the late stages of that pro- cess, and should prove to be a valuable system for study- ing it without having to evolve the orbits leading up to the merger. The paper is organized as follows: In section II we detail the mathematical construction of the data sets and discuss some of their properties, such as their masses, for several subclasses of the spacetimes. Then in section III we discuss a series of tools we have developed to study the initial data sets, such as the apparent horizons and their intrinsic geometry. In section IV we survey many initial data sets, describe their features, and discuss application of the hoop conjecture and Penrose inequality. Finally in section V we summarize the results. II. CONSTRUCTING DISTORTED, ROTATING BLACK HOLES A. Initial Data In this section we provide details of the construction of this new family of distorted, rotating black hole data sets. Some details were provided in Ref. [22], but as this paper focuses exclusively on the initial value problem we present a more comprehensive treatment here. To moti- vate the problem, consider  rst the Kerr metric, written in Boyer-Lindquist form [26]: g (K)    = 0 B B @ g tt (K) 00g t  (K) 0 g rr (K) 00 00g    (K) 0 g t  (K) 00g    (K) 1 C C A g (K) rr =   2 =  g (K)    =   2 g (K) tt =   a 2 sin 2       =  2 g (K) t  = 2amrsin 2  =  2 g (K)    =     r 2 +a 2   2   a 2 sin 2     sin 2  =  2  =r 2  2mr +a 2   2 = r 2 +a 2 cos 2  ; (1) where m is the mass of the Kerr black hole, a is the angu- lar momentum parameter, and a superscript (K) denotes the Kerr spacetime. We would like to put this in a form that is free of coor- dinate singularities, and that has properties similar to the form used in the non-rotating black hole studies [4,17,27]. Generalizing the transformation used in Ref. [4,17,27] we de ne a new radial coordinate  through r = r + cosh 2 ( =2) r   sinh 2 ( =2); (2a) r   = m  p m 2  a 2 : (2b) With this transformation the spatial part of the Kerr metric can be written as dl 2 =  4 0   e  2q 0   d  2 +d  2   +sin 2  d  2   (3) where   4 0 = g (K)    =sin 2  (4a)   4 0 e  2q 0 = g (K) rr   dr d    2 = g (K)    : (4b) Thus we see that our coordinate transformation (2) has resulted in a \quasi-isotropic gauge" [28] for the Kerr spacetime. Notice also that if a =0thenq 0 =0and we recover the Schwarzschild 3-metric. This metric is now in the form used in the previous NCSA black hole studies [3,4,17,29], although here the functions q 0 and   0 are determined by the Kerr spacetime. One may check that the 3{metric de ned by Eq. (3) is invariant under the transformation  !  , i.e., there is an isometry operation across the throat of an Einstein-Rosen bridge located at  = 0, just as in the Schwarzschild spacetime [30]. This construction has two geometrically identical sheets connected smoothly at the throat, located at  = 0. In terms of the more familiar radial coordinates, this condition can be expressed as  r!   m 2  a 2   =(4 r); (5) where  r is a generalization of the Schwarzschild isotropic radius, de ned as  r = p m 2  a 2 2 e   : (6a)  r is related to the usual Boyer-Lindquist radial coordinate via r = r   1+ m+a 2 r    1+ m a 2 r   : (6b) Note that in the Kerr spacetime the horizon, located at r = m + p m 2  a 2 ,isat r = p m 2  a 2 =2inthe r co- ordinates, or at  = 0, just as in previous studies of the Schwarzschild spacetime [30]. The isometry condition  !  will be used in the construction of more gen- eral initial data sets to be described below, and is also imposed during the evolution as well [23]. The 3-metric, however, comprises only half of our ini- tial data. The extrinsic curvature on the initial slice is 2 required as well, and for the Kerr spacetime it is given by the equations ^ K    = am   2r 2   r 2 +a 2   +  2   r 2  a 2    sin 2     4 (7a) ^ K    = 2a 3 mr  1=2 cos sin 3     4 ; (7b) wherewenotethatK ij =   2 0 ^ K ij , and all extrinsic cur- vature components excepting the two listed are zero. One can show that this metric and extrinsic curvature satisfy the both the Hamiltonian constraint R+K 2  K ij K ij =0 (8) and the three momentum constraints r i   K ij    ij K   =0; (9) as they must. Finally we must specify the lapse and shift to com- plete the system for evolution. The choices that make the stationary nature of this Kerr spacetime explicit are: 1   2 =1+2mr   r 2 +a 2    2   (10) and     =  2amr (r 2 +a 2 ) 2  a 2  sin 2   : (11) We have now written the Kerr spacetime in 3+1 form, in a coordinate system like that used to evolve the non- rotating distorted black holes in previous work. This is a stationary spacetime, and it can be evolved using a dy- namic slicing condition just as the Schwarzschild space- time has been evolved using maximal and other slicing conditions. But just as in the case of Schwarzschild, we can distort this rotating black hole with a gravitational (\Brill") wave and study its response. We accomplish this by adding a free function q( ; ) to the conformal 3{metric in Eq. (3), just as in Ref. [17]. Then the conformal factor   0 , which is a solution only for the stationary Kerr spacetime, will no longer satisfy the Hamiltonian constraint (8). Instead we must solve this constraint equation for the general conformal factor  as we discuss below. This generalization results in a 3-metric with the following form: dl 2 =  4 h e 2(q q 0 )   d  2 +d  2   +sin 2  d  2 i : (12) Apart from the function q 0 this is the same 3-metric used for the non-rotating distorted black hole spacetime. This illustrates the fact that unlike the Schwarzschild space- time the undistorted Kerr spacetime is not conformally  at ( ^ R6=0,where ^ R is the scalar curvature of the con- formal part of the 3{metric). We may, in fact, make the spacetime conformally  at by adding a \Brill wave" [19] speci ed by q = q 0 . This distorts the Kerr black hole, which breaks the stationary nature of the spacetime. As we will show below, appropriate choices of this function q (along with appropriate solutions to the momentum con- straint for the extrinsic curvature terms) can lead also to Schwarzschild, the NCSA distorted non-rotating black hole (as in Ref. [17]), the Bowen and York rotating black hole [19], or a distorted Bowen and York black hole. The functionq, representing the Brill wave, can be cho- sen somewhat arbitrarily, subject to symmetry conditions on the throat, axis and equator, and fallo conditions at large radii [17,22]. The function q will be chosen to have an inversion symmetric (i.e., symmetric under  !  ) Gaussian part given by: q =sin n  q G ; (13a) q G = Q 0   e  s + +e  s     ; (13b) s   =(    0 ) 2 =  2 : (13c) This form of the Brill wave will be characterized by sev- eral parameters: Q 0 (its amplitude),  (its width),   0 (its coordinate location), and n, specifying its angular dependence, which must be positive and even. We note that Eqs. (13) simply provide a convenient way to pa- rameterize the initial data sets, and to allow us to easily adjust the \Brill wave" part of the initial data. Many other devices are possible. To narrow the  eld of study, in this paper we restrict ourselves to sets characterized by n =2,and  0 = 0 for all data sets, and will commonly use  =1:5 With this form of the Brill wave function q,anum- ber of black hole data sets can be constructed. As dis- cussed above, given the appropriate extrinsic curvature choice, the stationary Kerr solution results if q =0. For other choices the Bowen and York form results if q = q 0 , a distorted Bowen and York spacetime can be made by setting q =sin n  q G + q 0 ; and a distorted Kerr space- time can be made by setting q =sin n  q G .Furthermore, for spacetimes without angular momentum this metric form contains both the NCSA Brill wave plus black hole spacetimes and, as we will see below, a new black hole spacetime corresponding to odd-parity distortions of the Schwarzschild spacetime. As a consequence of this generalization of the metric, we must now solve both the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints. The Hamiltonian constraint equation (8) can be expanded in coordinate form to yield @ 2   @  2 + @ 2   @  2 + @  @  cot     4 =     4   @ 2 @  2 (q q 0 )+ @ 2 @  2 (q q 0 )        7 4   ^ H 2 E sin 2  + ^ H 2 F   ; (14) where we have assumed the initial slice is maximal, i.e. trK = 0. There are in principle three momentum con- 3 straints to be satis ed by the extrinsic curvature compo- nents. However, in our spacetimes we require a \time- rotation" symmetry about the initial slice, or invariance of the metric under (t; ) ! ( t;  ). Writing the ex- trinsic curvature tensor as K ij =   2 ^ H ij =   2 0 @ ^ H A ^ H C ^ H E sin 2   ^ H C ^ H B ^ H F sin  ^ H E sin 2   ^ H F sin  ^ H D sin 2   1 A ; (15) this time-rotation symmetry requires that ^ H A = ^ H B = ^ H C = ^ H D =0,leavingonly ^ H E and ^ H F to be deter- mined. This also automatically makes the initial slice maximal. Under these conditions the only nontrivial component of the momentum constraints is the  component: @   ^ H E sin 3  +@     ^ H F sin 2     =0: (16) Note that this equation is independent of the functions q and q 0 : This enables us to choose the solutions to these equations independently of our choice of metric pertur- bation. At this point we may regard Eqs. (12-16) as de ning the problem we wish to solve. The boundary conditions for these equations, which are extensions of those used in Ref. [17], may be summarized as: Isometry Conditions: Across the throat of the black hole, labeled by  = 0, we can demand a condition that thespacetimehasthesamegeometryas !  .We can require this not only for the initial data, but also throughout the evolution of the spacetime. This condi- tion may be stated in one of two ways (in axisymmetry) to allow for di erent slicing conditions. Each choice must result in a symmetric K    andananti-symmetricK    to be consistent with the Kerr solution. Thus, the form of the isometry condition must be di erent for the symmet- ric and anti-symmetric lapse spacetimes:  !  for the former, ( ; )!(  ;  ) for the latter. If a lapse that is anti-symmetric across the throat is desired, the metric elements with a single  index are anti-symmetric across the throat, while those with zero or two indices are symmetric. The extrinsic curvature components have the opposite symmetry of their corre- sponding metric elements. The shift     is anti-symmetric across the throat, while all other shifts are symmetric. If a symmetric lapse is desired, the metric elements with a single  index or single  index (but not both) will be anti-symmetric at the throat and all others will be symmetric. Extrinsic curvature components will have the same symmetries as their corresponding metric ele- ments. The     and     shifts will be anti-symmetric, and the     shift will be symmetric. With these symmetries enforced, the initial data and all subsequent time slices will be isometric across the throat. One can verify that all Einstein equations respect these symmetries during the evolution if they are satis ed initially. Symmetry Axis: All metric elements, extrinsic curvature components, and shift components with a single  index are anti-symmetric across the axis. The remainder are symmetric. Equatorial Plane: At the equator there are two possible symmetries, the Kerr symmetry and the \cosmic screw" symmetry (see section II A 4 below). For the Kerr sym- metry,  !   , all metric components, extrinsic cur- vature components or shifts with a single  index are anti-symmetric. The remainder are symmetric. For the cosmic-screw type boundary conditions the symmetry at the equator is ( ; ) ! (   ;  )andthosemetric elements, extrinsic curvature components, or shift com- ponents that contain one  or one  index (but not both) are anti-symmetric. The remainder are symmetric. Outer Boundary: At the outer boundary a Robin con- dition is used for  . This condition gives the correct asymptotic behavior in the conformal factor to order r  2 . For the metric given in the form (12)  has the form  =e  =2 +(m=2)e   =2 +:::and therefore obeys the di er- ential equation  + 2@    =2e  =2 . The conformal factor is always symmetric at the throat, axis, and equator. With this description of the problem and boundary conditions, we summarize a number of families of rotating black hole solutions that are possible in this formulation: 1. Kerr and Distorted Kerr As shown above, Eqs. (12-16), together with the boundary conditions, are satis ed by the stationary Kerr spacetime with the transformations (2-7). In Eq. (12), this spacetime corresponds to q = 0, but as we have mentioned above, we may add a Brill wave function q =sin n  q G to distort the Kerr spacetime. From the standard ADM expressions for the mass and angular mo- mentum of the spacetime [31] we have M ADM =  1 2  I S r a ( e   =2 )dS a (17a) P a = 1 8  I S   H b a    b a H   dS b ; (17b) or in terms of the variables de ned in this paper, M ADM = Z   0 e  =2 ( @    + =2) sin d ; (18a) J = P   = 1 4 Z   0   6 H E sin 3  d : (18b) If one evaluates these expressions for the undistorted Kerr spacetime, (q = 0), one recovers the expected re- sults M ADM = m (which should be evaluated at  =1) and J = am(which may be evaluated at any radius in axisymmetry). In practice, we evaluate m at the outer 4 edge of our grid, and J is simply an input parameter. We have evaluated and veri ed J at various radii, as reported in previous work [22]. 2. Distorted Bowen and York Perhaps the simplest nontrivial choice of solution for the momentum constraint is given by the Bowen and York [19] solution ^ H E =3J (19a) ^ H F =0; (19b) where J is the total angular momentum of the spacetime. This solution clearly satis es the momentum constraint. In the language of this paper, the original Bowen and York solution has a Brill wave function determined by q = q 0 ; (20) i.e., it is conformally  at, but we may distort it by setting q = q 0 +sin n  q G : (21) This is the solution we often use in constructing distorted rotating black hole spacetimes, and a number of them have been evolved and discussed in Ref. [23]. It is some- what simpler to construct than the distorted Kerr be- cause we can choose our total angular momentum and distortion parameters without needing to know the ra- tio J=m 2 (an additional value that we would need to initialize the Kerr momentum solution). Knowing this parameter would require us to know the value m,and we will not know that parameter until after we solve the Hamiltonian constraint. It is possible, in principle, to iterate between guesses for the parameter J=m 2 and so- lutions for the Hamiltonian constraint until arriving at a correctly initialized Kerr momentum solution. We noted above that the Kerr solution is not confor- mally  at, while the Bowen and York solution is con- formally  at. Therefore one can consider adding a Brill wave to the Kerr solution, making it a conformally  at Bowen and York solution. One can study the form of the wave functions q and q 0 to understand what sort of Brill wave is required to \ atten" the Kerr solution. By equating the series expansions of q 0 and our Brill wave function (c.f. Eq. (4b)) q approx = a 1 sin 2  e    2 =  2 1 +a 2 sin 4  e    2 =  2 2 : (22) to second order in  and  , one obtains relationships be- tween the wave shape parameters a 1 , a 2 ,   1 ,and  2 and the Kerr parameters a and m. It turns out that for a=m < :9 we  nd that the sin 2  term dominates the sin 4  term, and   1 varies in value from 1:26 to 1:7for rotation parameters 0:01 a=m 0:8. Furthermore the amplitude a 1 varies smoothly from zero to about 0:38 for all rotation parameters 0 a=m 1. We conclude that the Bowen and York distortion is similar to a low am- plitude n =2, =1:5 Brill wave distortion on a Kerr black hole, which is quite similar in shape and size to the distorted, non-rotating black holes evolved previously [3]. To get a feel for the di erence between the q 0 function and its approximation, q approx ,wecalculatedtheADM value of a=M ADM as we would for the Kerr spacetime, except that we used q approx instead of q 0 in the metric. We found that the error in a=M ADM was less than 1%, even for a=m =0:9. 3. Odd-parity Distorted Schwarzschild Odd-parity gravitational modes, as de ned by Regge and Wheeler [32], are metric perturbations with parity ( 1) ‘+1 where ‘ is the angular index of the tensor spher- ical harmonic describing the wave. These modes, in ax- isymmetry, are formed only from perturbations in g r  and g    . The evolution of these modes does not cou- ple linearly to the even-parity modes, and if there is no odd-parity disturbance on the initial slice of the space- time these modes are never excited even when the full non-linear equations are used. We can create odd-parity distorted non-rotating space- times simply by  nding solutions to the momentum con- straint equation (16) which drive the evolution of g    , which satisfy the boundary conditions, and yield J =0 when the integral given in Eq. (18b) is performed. As a framework for momentum solutions, we consider the simple class de ned by: ^ H E = f 1 ( )+f 2 ( )(4 cos f 3 ( )+sin @   f 3 ( )) (23a) ^ H F = @   f 2 ( )sin 2  f 3 ( ): (23b) This solves the momentum constraint where f 1 , f 2 andf 3 are arbitrary functions which satisfy the following sym- metries: f 1 ( )=f 1 (  )=f 1 (   ) (24a) f 3 ( )= f 3 (  )= f 3 (   ) (24b) f 2 ( )=f 2 (  ) (24c) lim  !1 f 2 ( ) = 0 (24d) The Kerr solution is not a member of this class, but the Bowen and York solution does  t within it (f 1 =3J, f 2 = f 3 =0). Note that any spacetime with f 1 = 0 will have zero angular momentum, as ^ H E falls o for large values of the radial coordinate  , and furthermore the angular part of the integral in Eq.(18b)is identically zero by construction. We require f 2 to go to zero only so that we can make the spacetime asymptotically Kerr. We now turn to a solution that has no net angu- lar momentum, but one that is not time symmetric 5

From the FZZT brane partition function, there emerges a unified, geometric description of all these theories in terms of an auxiliary Riemann surface Mp,q and the corresponding matrix model. In terms of this geometric description, both the FZZT and ZZ branes correspond to line integrals of a certain one-form on Mp,q. Moreover, we argue that there are a finite number of distinct (m,n) ZZ branes, and we show that these ZZ branes are located at the singularities of Mp,q. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the bosonic and supersymmetric theories with (p,q) odd and relatively prime are identical, as is suggested by the unified treatment of these models. December, 2003 1. Introduction and conclusions In this work we will explore minimal string theories. These are simple examples of string theory with a small number of observables. Their simplicity makes them soluble and therefore they are interesting laboratories for string dynamics. The worldsheet description of these minimal string theories is based on the (p,q) minimal conformal field theories coupled to two-dimensional gravity (Liouville theory), or the (p,q) minimal superconformal field theories coupled to two-dimensional supergravity (super-Liouville theory). Even though these two worldsheet descriptions appear different, we find that actually they are quite similar. In fact, our final answer depends essentially only on the values of (p,q). This suggests a uniform presentation of all these theories which encompasses the two different worldsheet frameworks and extends them. These theories were first solved using their description in terms of matrix models [1-8] (for reviews, see e.g. [9,10]). The matrix model realizes the important theme of open/closed string duality in the study of string theory. Recent advances in the study of Liouvilletheory [11-13] and its D-branes [14-16] has led to progress by [17-24] and others in making the connection between the matrix model and the worldsheet description more explicit. Much of the matrix model treatment of these theories has involved a deformation by the lowest dimension operator. In order to match with the worldsheet description based on Liouville theory, we should instead tune the background such that only the cosmological constant µ is turned on. In [25] such backgrounds were referred to as conformal backgrounds. In the first part of this work, we will examine the simplest examples of minimal string theory, which are based on the bosonic (p,q) minimal models coupled to two-dimensional gravity. These theories, which we review in section 2, exist for all relatively prime integers (p,q). It is important that these theories have only a finite number of standard physical vertex operators Tr,s of ghost number one; we will refer to these as tachyons. They are constructed by “dressing” the minimal model primaries Or,s with Liouville exponentials, subject to the condition that the combinations have conformal dimension one. They are labelled by integers r = 1,...,p? 1 and s = 1,...,q ? 1, and they are subject to the identification Tr,s ?Tp?r,q?s, which can be implemented by restricting to qr>ps. In addition to the tachyons, there are infinitely many physical operators at other values of the ghost number [26]. Of special importance are the operators at ghost number zero. These form a ring [27] under multiplication by the operator product expansion modulo 1 BRST commutators. We will argue that the ring is generated by two operators hatwideO1,2 and hatwideO2,1. In terms of the operators hatwidex = 12 hatwideO1,2 , hatwidey = 12 hatwideO2,1 , (1.1) the other elements in the ring are hatwideOr,s = Us?1(hatwidex)Ur?1(hatwidey) (1.2) where the U are the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind Ur?1(cos?) = sin(r?)sin? and for simplicity we are setting here the cosmological constant µ = 1. The ring has only (p?1)(q?1) elements. The restriction on the values of (r,s) is implemented by the ring relations Uq?1(hatwidex) = 0 , Up?1(hatwidey) = 0 . (1.3) The tachyons Tr,s form a module of the ring, which is simply understood by writing Tr,s = hatwideOr,sT1,1. The restriction in the tachyon module rq > ps implies that the module is not a faithful representation of the ring. Instead, there is an additional relation in the ring when acting on the tachyon module: parenleftbigU q?2(hatwidex)?Up?2(hatwidey) parenrightbigT r,s = 0 . (1.4) The ground ring will enable us to compute some simple correlation functions such as ?Tr1,s1Tr2,s2Tr3,s3? = N(r1,s1)(r2,s2)(r3,s3)?T1,1T1,1T1,1? (1.5) with N(r1,s1)(r2,s2)(r3,s3) the integer fusion rules of the minimal model. In sections 3 and 4, we study the two types of branes in these theories, which are referred to as the FZZT and ZZ branes [14-16]. The former were previously explored in the context of matrix models as operators that create macroscopic loops [28,25,29,30]. The Liouville expressions for these loops [14,15] lead to more insight. The general Liouville expressions simplify in our case for two reasons. First, the Liouville coupling constant b2 is rational, b2 = pq; and second, we are not interested in the generic Liouville operator but only in those which participate in the physical (i.e. BRST invariant) operators of the minimal string theory. It turns out that these branes are labelled by a continuous parameter x which can be identified with the boundary cosmological constant µB. This 2 parameter can be analytically continued, but it does not take values on the complex plane. Rather, it is defined on a Riemann surface Mp,q which is given by the equation F(x,y) ?Tq(x)?Tp(y) = 0 (1.6) with Tp(cos?) = cos(p?) a Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind. This Riemann surface has genus zero, but it has (p?1)(q?1)/2 singularities that can be thought of as pinched A-cycles of a higher-genus surface. In addition to (1.6), the singularities must satisfy ?xF(x,y) = qUq?1(x) = 0 ?yF(x,y) = pUp?1(y) = 0 . (1.7) Rewriting the conditions (1.6) and (1.7) as Uq?1(x) = Up?1(y) = 0 Uq?2(x)?Up?2(y) = 0 , (1.8) we immediately recognize the first line as the ring relations (1.3), and the second line as the relation in the tachyon module (1.4). Deformations of the curve (1.6) correspond to the physical operators of the minimal string theory. Among them we find all the expected bulk physical operators, namely the tachyons, the ring elements and the physical operators at negative ghost number. There are also deformations of the curve that do not correspond to bulk physical operators. We interpret these to be open string operators. A useful object is the one form ydx. Its integral on Mp,q from a fixed reference point (which we can take to be at x ? ?) to the point µB is the FZZT disk amplitude with boundary cosmological constant µB: Z(µB) = integraldisplay µB ydx . (1.9) We can also consider closed contour integrals of this one-form through the pinched cycles of Mp,q. This leads to disk amplitudes for the ZZ branes: Zm,n = contintegraldisplay Bm,n ydx . (1.10) This integral can also be written as the difference between FZZT branes on the two sides of the singularity [24]. Such a relation between the two types of branes follows from the work of [16,31,32] and was made most explicit in [18]. 3 The relations (1.8) which are satisfied at the singularities, together with the result (1.10), suggest the interpretation of the (m,n) ZZ brane states as eigenstates of the ring generators hatwidex and hatwidey, with eigenvalues xmn and ymn corresponding to the singularities of Mp,q: hatwidex|m,n?ZZ = xmn|m,n?ZZ , hatwidey|m,n?ZZ = ymn|m,n?ZZ . (1.11) We alsofind thatthese eigenvalues completely specify the BRST cohomology class ofthe ZZ brane. In other words, branes located at the same singularity of Mp,q differ by a BRST exact state, while branes located at different singularities are distinct physical states. Moreover, branes that do not correspond to singularities of our surface are themselves BRST exact. Thus there are as many distinct ZZ branes as there are singularities of Mp,q in (p,q) minimal string theory. A natural question is the physical interpretation of the uniformization parameter ? of our surface, defined by x= cos?. The answer is given in appendix A, where we discuss the (nonlocal) Backlund transformation that maps the Liouville field ? to a free field ˜?. We will see that ? can be identified with the Backlund field, which satisfies Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the second part of our paper we will study the minimal superstring theories, which are obtained by coupling (p,q) superminimal models to supergravity. These theories fall in two classes. The odd models exist for p and q odd and relatively prime. They (spon- taneously) break worldsheet supersymmetry. The even models exist for p and q even, p/2 and q/2 relatively prime and (p?q)/2 odd. Our discussion parallels that in the bosonic string and the results are very similar. There are however a few new elements. The first difference from the bosonic system is the option of using the 0A or 0B GSO projection. Most of our discussion will focus on the 0B theory. In either theory, there is a globalZ2 symmetry (?1)FL, where FL is the left-moving spacetime fermion number. This symmetry multiplies all the RR operators by ?1 and is broken when background RR fields are turned on. Orbifolding the 0B theory by (?1)FL leads to the 0A theory and vice versa. A second important difference relative to the bosonic system is that here the cos- mological constant µ can be either positive or negative, and the results depend on its sign ? = sign(µ) . (1.12) This sign can be changed by performing aZ2 R-transformation in the super-Liouville part of the theory. It acts there as (?1)fL with fL the left moving worldsheet fermion number. 4 
Fisica Alain J. Brizard Saint Michael's College Motion in a Non-InertialFrame 1TimeDerivatives in Fixed and Rotating Frames Let us consider the time derivative of an arbitrary vector A in two reference frames. The ¯rst reference frame is called the ¯xed frame and is expressed intermsoftheCartesian coordinates r 0 =(x 0 ;y 0 ;z 0 ). The second reference frame is called the rotating frame and is expressed intermsoftheCartesian coordinates r =(x;y;z). In the Figure below, the rotating frame shares the same origin as the ¯xed frame and the rotation angular velocity ! of the rotating frame (with respect to the ¯xed frame) has components (! x ;! y ;! z ). Since observations are often made in a rotating frame of reference, we decompose the vector A in terms of components A i in the rotating frame (with unitvectors bx i ). Thus, A = A i b x i (using the summation rule) and the time derivative of A as observed in the ¯xed frame is dA dt = dA i dt b x i + A i dbx i dt : (1) The interpretation of the ¯rst term is that of the time derivative of A as observed in the rotating frame (where the unit vectors bx i are constant) while the second term involves the time-dependence of the relation between the¯xedandrotating frames. Wenowexpress d b x i =dt as a vector in the rotating frame as d b x i dt = R ij bx j = ² ijk ! k bx j ; (2) 1 where R represents the rotation matrix associated with the rotating frame of reference; this rotation matrix is anti-symmetric (R ij = ¡R ji )andcanbewritten in terms of the anti-symmetric tensor ² ijk (de¯ned intermsofthevector productA£B = A i B j ² ijk bx k for two arbitrary vectors A and B)asR ij = ² ijk ! k ,where! k denotes the components of the angular velocity ! in the rotating frame. Hence, the second term in Eq. (1) becomes A i d b x i dt = A i ² ijk ! k b x j = !£A: (3) The time derivative of an arbitrary rotating-frame vector A in a ¯xed frame is,therefore, expressed as Ã dA dt ! f = Ã dA dt ! r + !£A; (4) where (d=dt) f denotes the time derivative as observed in the ¯xed (f)framewhile(d=dt) r denotes the time derivative as observed in the rotating (r)frame.Animportant application of this formula relates to the time derivative of the rotation angular velocity ! itself. One can easily see that Ã d! dt ! f =_! = Ã d! dt ! r ; since the second term in Eq. (4) vanishes for A = !;thetimederivative of ! is, therefore, the sameinbothframesofreference and is denoted _! in what follows. 2Acelerations in Rotating Frames We now consider the general case of a rotating frame and ¯xed frame being related by translation androtation. 2 In the Figureabove,theposition ofa point P according to the¯xed frame of reference is labeled r 0 ,while the position of the same point according to the rotating frame of reference is labeled r,and r 0 = R + r; (5) where R denotes the position of the origin of the rotating frame according to the ¯xed frame. Since the velocity of the point P involves the rate of change of position, we must now be careful in de¯ning which time-derivative operator, (d=dt) f or (d=dt) r ,isused. The velocities of point P as observed in the ¯xed and rotating frames are de¯ned as v f = Ã dr 0 dt ! f and v r = Ã dr dt ! r ; (6) respectively. Using Eq. (4), the relation between the ¯xed-frame and rotating-frame veloc- ities isexpressedas v f = Ã dR dt ! f + Ã dr dt ! f = V + v r + !£r; (7) where V =(dR=dt) f denotes the translation velocity oftherotating-frame origin (as observed in the ¯xedframe). UsingEq. (7), we arenow in apositiontoevaluateexpressionsfor theacceleration of point P as observed in the ¯xed and rotating frames of reference a f = Ã dv f dt ! f and a r = Ã dv r dt ! r ; (8) respectively. Hence, using Eq. (7), we ¯nd a f = Ã dV dt ! f + Ã dv r dt ! f + Ã d! dt ! f £r + !£ Ã dr dt ! f = A +(a r + !£v r )+_!£r + !£ (v r + !£r); or a f = A + a r +2!£v r +_!£r + !£ (!£r); (9) where A =(dV=dt) f denotesthe translational acceleration of the rotating-frame origin (as observed inthe¯xed frame of reference). We can now write an expression for the acceleration of point P as observed in the rotating frame as a r = a f ¡ A ¡ !£ (!£r) ¡ 2!£v r ¡ _!£r; (10) which represents the sum of the net inertial acceleration (a f ¡A), the centrifugal acceler- ation ¡!£ (!£r)(seeFigurebelow) 3 the Coriolis acceleration ¡2!£v r (see Figure below) andanangular acceleration term ¡ _!£r which depends explicitly on the time dependence of the rotation angular velocity !. The centrifugal acceleration (which is directed outwardly from the rotation axis) rep- resents a familiar non-inertial e®ect in physics. A less familiar non-inertial e®ect is the Coriolis acceleration. The Figure above shows that an object falling inwardly also experi- ences an eastward acceleration. 3LagrangianFormulation of Non-Inertial Motion The Lagrangian for a particle of mass m moving in a non-inertial rotating frame (with its origin coinciding with the ¯xed-frame origin) in the presence of the potential U(r)is expressed as L(r; _r)= m 2 j_r + !£rj 2 ¡ U(r); (11) where ! is the angular velocity vector and we use the formula j_r + !£rj 2 = j_rj 2 +2!¢ (r£ _r)+ h ! 2 r 2 ¡ (!¢r) 2 i : 4 Using the Lagrangian (11), we now derive the general Euler-Lagrange equation for r.First, we derive an expression for the canonical momentum p = @L @_r = m(_r + !£r); (12) and d dt Ã @L @_r ! = m(Är + _!£r + !£ _r): Next, we derivethepartial derivative @L @r = ¡rU(r) ¡ m[ !£ _r + !£ (!£r)]; so that the Euler-Lagrange equations are m Är = ¡rU(r) ¡ m[_!£r +2!£ _r + !£ (!£r)]: (13) Here,the potentialenergyterm generates the ¯xed-frame acceleration, ¡rU = ma f ,and thus the Euler-Lagrange equation (13) yields Eq. (10). 4MotionRelative to Earth We can now applytheseexpressions to the important case of the ¯xed frame of reference having its originatthecenter of Earth (point O 0 in the Figure below) and the rotating frame of reference having its origin at latitude ¸ and longitude Ã (point O in the Figure below). We note that the rotation of the Earth is now represented as _ Ã = ! and that _! =0. 5

Fisica arXiv:gr-qc/9605072 v1   31 May 1996 IFUP-TH 25/96 May 1996 gr-qc/9605072 Spectrum of relic gravitational waves in string cosmology Alessandra Buonanno, Michele Maggiore and Carlo Ungarelli Dipartimento di Fisica dell’Universit`a and INFN, piazza Torricelli 2, I-56100 Pisa, Italy. Abstract. We compute the spectrum of relic gravitons in a model of string cosmology. In the low- and in the high-frequency limits we re- produce known results. The full spectrum, however, also displays a series of oscillations which could give a characteristic signature at the planned LIGO/VIRGO detectors. For special values of the parameters of the model the signal reaches its maximum already at frequencies accessible to LIGO and VIRGO and it is close to the sensitivity of first generation experiments. 1 Introduction In the next few years a number of detectors for gravitational waves, and in particular the LIGO and VIRGO interferometers, are expected to start operating in a range of frequencies between 10Hz and 1kHz. One of the possible signals which could be searched, correlating the output of two detectors, is a stochastic background of gravitational waves. This background is expected to have different components, with different origin: it will get contributions from a large number of unresolved sources at modest red-shifts, as well as from radiation of cosmological origin. The latter is especially interesting, since it would carry informations about the state of the very early universe. The basic mechanism of generation of relic gravitational waves in cosmology has been discussed in a number of papers, see e.g. refs. [1, 2], the reviews [3, 4] and references therein. The spectrum can be conveniently expressed using ?gw(f) = 1? c d?gw dlogf where?c isthe critical density ofthe universe,?gw isthe energy density ingravitational waves and f is the frequency. Particular attention has been paid to the spectrum produced in inflationary cosmology. In this case one finds that ?gw decreases with frequency as f?2 from 10?18 Hz to 10?16 Hz, and then it is flat up to a maximum cutoff frequency f ? 1010 Hz. While the frequency dependence of ?gw(f) is fixed, its magnitudedepends ona parameter of themodel, theHubble constant during inflation. An upper bound on the spectrum can be obtained from the measurement of COBE of the anisotropy of the microwave background radiation. Via the Sachs-Wolfe effect, a large energy density in gravitational waves at wavelengths comparable to the present Hubble radius would produce fluctuations in the temperature of the photon cosmic background. This gives a limit on ?gw [5] of about 8·10?14 at f ? 10?16 Hz . Since for larger frequencies the spectrum predicted by inflation is flat, this bound also holds at the frequencies of interest for LIGO and VIRGO. The planned sensitivities of these experiments to a stochastic background are of the order of ?gw ? 5·10?6, while the advanced LIGO project aims at 5·10?11 [5]. In any case, the spectrum predicted by these inflationary models is too low to be observed. Clearly, in order to have a stochastic background which satisfies the COBE bound, but still has a chance of being observable at LIGO or VIRGO, the spectrum must grow with frequency. A spectrum of this type has been found in ref. [6] in a cosmological model suggested by string theory [7, 8, 9]. Because of its fast ( ? f3) growth with frequency at low f, the COBE bound is easily evaded, and the most relevant bound for this type of spectrum comes from nucleosynthesis. The result is that, for a certain range of values of the parameters of the model, the spectrum might be accessible at the interferometer experiments, at least at the advanced level, while satisfying the existing experimental bounds. 1 In ref. [6] this spectrum has been estimated, using approximate methods, in the low- and in the high-frequency limits, and neglecting overall numerical factors. In this paper we present a detailed computation of the spectrum, solving exactly the relevant differential equations. We fix the numerical factors and we present the frequency dependence in the intermediate region. The latter displays an interesting feature: it shows a series of oscillations, which might provide a characteristic experimental signature. As remarked in [6], one must be aware of the fact that it might not be legitimate to use field-theoretical methods during the ’stringy phase’ of the cosmological model, see sect. 2, and large frequencies are indeed sensitive to this phase. However the best one can do, at this stage, is to write down a specific cosmological model and see what are its predictions. Of course, these predictions should only be considered as indicative. 2 The model The low energy string effective action depends on the metric gµ? and on the dilaton field ? (we neglect the antisymmetric tensor field). At lowest order in the derivatives and in e? it is given by S = ? 12?2 s integraldisplay d4x??g bracketleftBig e?? (R+?µ??µ?)?Vdil(?) bracketrightBig , (1) where ?s is the string lenght and ? is the dilaton field. The dilaton potential Vdil(?) is due to non-perturbative effects and therefore vanishes as exp(?cexp(??)) for ? large and negative, with c a positive constant. We consider a homogeneous, isotropic and spatially flat background, ? = ?(t),ds2 = dt2 ? a2(t)dx2, and we introduce conformal time ?, dt = a(?)d?. The pre-big-bang scenario proposed by Gasperini and Veneziano [7, 8, 9] suggests the following choice for the background metric and dilaton field. For ??<?<?s, with ?s < 0, we have a dilaton-dominated regime with a(?) = ? 1H s?s parenleftBigg??(1??)? s ??s parenrightBigg?? (2) ?(?) = ?s ??log ??(1??)?s? s . (3) With the values ? = 1/(1+?3),? = ?3 this is a solution of the equations of motion derived from the effective action (1) in the absence of external matter [7]. At a value ? = ?s the curvature becomes of the order of the string scale, and the lowest order effective action (1) does not give anymore a good description. We are in a full ’stringy’ regime. One expects that higher order corrections to the effective action 2 tame the growth of the curvature, and both (1/a)da/dtandd?/dtstay approximately constant. In terms of conformal time, this means a(?) = ? 1H s? , ?(?) = ?s ?2?log ?? s (4) The stringy phase lasts for ?s <? <?1 < 0. One then expects that at this stage the dilaton potential becomes operative and, either with a modification of the classical equations of motion due to the dilaton potential [10], or via quantum tunneling [11] the solution joins the standard radiation dominated solution with constant dilaton, which is also a solution of the string equations of motion derived from the action (1), with external bulk stringy matter [7]. This gives, for ?1 <? <?r, (with ?r > 0) a(?) = 1H s?21 (??2?1), ? = ?0. (5) After that, the standard matter dominated era takes place. We have chosen the additive and multiplicative constants in a(?) in such a way that a(?) and da/d? (and therefore also da/dt) are continuous across the transitions. The equation for the Fourier modes of metric tensor perturbations for the two physical polarizations in the transverse traceless gauge is [12] d2?k d?2 + bracketleftBig k2 ?V(?) bracketrightBig ?k = 0, (6) V(?) = 1ae?/2 d 2 d?2(ae ??/2). (7) Inserting the expressions (2-5) the potential is V(?) = 14 (4?2 ?1)(??(1??)?s)?2, ??<?<?s V(?) = 14 (4µ2 ?1)??2, ?s <? <?1 (8) V(?) = 0, ?1 <?<?r where 2µ = |2??3|,2? = |2??? + 1|. The exact solutions of eq. (6) in the three regions are ?k(?) = radicalBig |??(1??)?s|CH(2)?

The constants A±,B± can be obtained requiring the continuity of the solution and of its derivative. We have chosen the boundary conditions so that, at ? ???, ?k ? exp(ik?). In this case the number of particles created per unit cell of the phase space is given by |B?|2. Before performing the matching, let us discuss the parameters of the model. The two constants?,? parametrize the solution in the dilaton dominated phase and there- fore they are fixed by the effective action (1): ? = 1/(1+?3),? = ?3 and then? = 0 (anyway, we will write many of our results for generic ?). Instead µ (or ?) is a free parameter which measures the growth of the dilaton during the stringy phase; by definition µ? 0. The parameter Hs is the Hubble constant during the stringy phase. Since in this model the growth of the curvature can only be stopped by the inclusion of higher order terms in the string effective action, it is clear that the natural value for Hs is of the order of the inverse of the string length ?s. If one uses the value ?2s ? (2/?GUT)L2Pl ? 40L2Pl then the typical value of Hs is Hs ? 1/?s ? 0.15Mpl where Mpl is the Planck mass. Finally, there are the two parameters ?s,?1. In the solution for ?k, and therefore in the spectrum, they appear in the combinations k|?s|,k|?1|, where k is the comoving wave number. If we denote by 2pif the physical frequency observed at a detector, we have 2pif = k/a(tpres), where tpres is the present value of cosmic time. Therefore, using eq. (4), k|?1| = 2pifa(tpres)|?1| = 2pifH s a(tpres) a(t1) = 2pif Hs parenleftBiggt pres teq parenrightBigg2/3parenleftbiggt eq t1 parenrightbigg1/2 , (10) where teq ? 3.4 · 1010h?40 s is the time of matter-radiation equilibrium, and tpres = 2/(3H0) ? 2.1·1017h?10 s. The constanth0 parametrizes the uncertainty in the present value of the Hubble constant H0 = 3.2·10?18h0 Hz, and it cancels in eq. (10); t1 is the value of cosmic time when the string phase ends. In this context, the natural choice is t1 ??s. Therefore the parameter ?1 can be traded for a parameter f1 defined by k|?1| = ff 1 , f1 ? 4.3·1010Hz parenleftBigg H s 0.15Mpl parenrightBigg parenleftbiggt 1 ?s parenrightbigg1/2 . (11) The order of magnitude off1 is therefore fixed. Note that at the frequencies of interest for LIGO and VIRGO f ranges between 10Hz and 1kHz, and f/f1 is a very small quantity. Similarly we can introduce a parameter fs instead of ?s, from k|?s| = f/fs. This parameter depends on the duration of the string phase, and it is therefore totally unknown, even as an order of magnitude. However, since |?1|<|?s|, we have fs <f1. To summarize, the model has a dimensionful parameter fs, which can have any value in the range 0 <fs <f1 and a dimensionless parameterµ? 0 (or equivalently? with 2µ = |2??3|). The dimensionless constants?,? are fixed, ? = 1/(1+?3),? = 0 and the dimensionful constants Hs,f1 are fixed within an uncertainty of about one or two orders of magnitude. The constant ?s appearing in eq. (2) drops out from the potential, eq. (7), and it is therefore irrelevant for our purposes.1 1For comparison, in ref. [6] the two parameters which are not fixed are chosen as gs/g1, which in 4

Greene? and David R. Morrison? We analyze the moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds and their associated confor- mally invariant nonlinear ?-models and show that they are described by an unexpectedly rich geometrical structure. Specifically, the K¨ahler sector of the moduli space of such Calabi-Yau conformal theories admits a decomposition into adjacent domains some of which correspond to the (complexified) K¨ahler cones of topologically distinct manifolds. These domains are separated by walls corresponding to singular Calabi-Yau spaces in which the spacetime metric has degenerated in certain regions. We show that the union of these domains is isomorphic to the complex structure moduli space of a single topological Calabi-Yau space — the mirror. In this way we resolve a puzzle for mirror symmetry raised by the apparent asymmetry between the K¨ahler and complex structure moduli spaces of a Calabi-Yau manifold. Furthermore, using mirror symmetry, we show that we can inter- polate in a physically smooth manner between any two theories represented by distinct points in the K¨ahler moduli space, even if such points correspond to topologically distinct spaces. Spacetime topology change in string theory, therefore, is realized by the most basic operation of deformation by a truly marginal operator. Finally, this work also yields some important insights on the nature of orbifolds in string theory. 8/93 † School of Natural Sciences, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ 08540. ? F.R.

One such path has been the attempt to extract detailed and specific low energy models from string theory in an attempt to make contact with observable physics. A wealth of research towards this end has shown conclusively that string theory contains within it all of the ingredients essential to building the standard model and that, if we are maximally optimistic about those things we do not understand at present, fairly realistic low energy models can be constructed. The second research path has focused on those properties of the theory which are generic to all models based on strings and which are difficult, if not impossible, to accommodate in a theory based on point particles. Such properties single out characteristic “stringy” phenomena and hence constitute the true distinguishing features of string theory. With our present inability to extract definitive low energy predictions from string theory, there is strong motivation to study these generic features. One such feature was identified some time ago in the work of [1]. These authors showed that whereas point particle theories appear to require a smooth background space- time, string theory is well defined in the presence of a certain class of spacetime singu- larities: toroidal quotient singularities. Another characteristically stringy feature is that of mirror symmetry and mirror manifolds. Mirror symmetry was conjectured based upon naturality arguments in [2,3], was strongly suggested by the computer studies of [4], and was established to exist in certain cases by direct construction in [5]. The phenomenon of mirror manifolds shows that vastly different spacetime backgrounds can give rise to identical physics — something quite unexpected in nonstring based theories such as gen- eral relativity and Kaluza-Klein theory. The present work is a natural progression along these lines of research. By using mirror symmetry we show, amongst other things, that the topology of spacetime can change by passing through a mathematically singular space while the physics of string theory is perfectly well behaved. From a more general vantage point, the present work focuses on the structure of the moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds and their associated superconformal nonlinear ?- models. There has been much work on this subject over the last few years [6], mainly focusing on local properties. The burden of the sequel is to show that an investigation of more global properties reveals a remarkably rich structure. As we shall see, whereas previ- ous studies [6] have, as a prime example, considered the local geometry of the complexified K¨ahler cone for a Calabi-Yau space of a fixed topology, we find that a more global perspec- tive shows that numerous such K¨ahler cones for topologically distinct Calabi-Yau spaces 1 (and other more exotic entities to be discussed) fit together by adjoining along common walls to form what we term the enlarged K¨ahler moduli space. The common walls of these K¨ahler cones correspond to metrically degenerate Calabi-Yau spaces in which some homo- logically nontrivial cycle has zero volume. In other words, points in these walls correspond to a configuration in which some nontrivial subvariety of the Calabi-Yau space (or, in fact, the whole Calabi-Yau itself!) is shrunk down to a point. Nonetheless, we show, by making use of mirror symmetry, that a generic point in such a wall corresponds to a perfectly well behaved conformal field theory. In fact, the generic point in such a wall has no special significance from the point of view of conformal field theory and hence none from the point of view of physics. As is familiar from previous studies, one can move around a path in moduli space by changing the expectation value of truly marginal operators. We show that a typical path passes through these walls without any unusual physical consequence. Hence, this makes it evident that it is physically incomplete to study a single K¨ahler cone. There are four main implications of this newfound need to pass from a single com- plexified K¨ahler cone to the enlarged K¨ahler moduli space: 1) Mirror symmetry, combined with standard reasoning from conformal field theory, leads one to the conclusion that if X and Y are a mirror pair of Calabi-Yau spaces then the complexified K¨ahler moduli space of X is isomorphic to the complex structure moduli space of Y and vice versa [5]. This is a puzzling statement mathematically because a complexified K¨ahler moduli space is a bounded domain (as we shall discuss this is due to the usual constraints that the K¨ahler form should yield positive volumes) whereas a complex structure moduli space is not bounded, but is rather of the form A?B with A and B subvarieties of some projective space [7]. The present work shows that the true object which is mirror to a complex structure moduli space is not a single complexified K¨ahler cone, but rather the enlarged K¨ahler moduli space introduced above. We show that the latter has an identical mathematical description (using toric geometry) as the mirror’s complex structure moduli space, thus resolving this important issue. 2) In the example considered in [8] and discussed in greater detail here, the enlarged K¨ahler moduli space consists of 100 distinct regions. In the more familiar example of the mirror of the quintic hypersurface, we expect the number of regions in the enlarged K¨ahler moduli space to be far greater – possibly many orders of magnitude greater – than in the example studied here. An important question is to give the physical interpretation of the theories in each region. In [8] we found that five of the 100 regions in our example were 2 interpretable as the complexified K¨ahler moduli spaces of five topologically distinct Calabi- Yau spaces related by the operation of flopping [9,10]. We will review this shortly. What about the other 95 regions? We will postpone a detailed answer to this question to section VI and also to a forthcoming paper, but there is one essential point worthy of emphasis here. Some of these regions correspond to Calabi-Yau spaces with orbifold singularities (similar to those studied in [1] except that the covering space is a nontoroidal Calabi-Yau space). Conventional wisdom and detailed analyses have always considered such orbifolds to be “boundary points in Calabi-Yau moduli space”. This implies, in particular, that smooth Calabi-Yau theories are represented by the generic points in moduli space while orbifold theories are special isolated points. It also implies that by giving any nonzero expectation value to “blow-up modes” in the orbifold theory, we move from the orbifold theory to a smooth Calabi-Yau theory. The present work shows that these interpretations of the orbifold results are misleading. Rather, it is better to think of orbifold theories as occupying their own regions in the enlarged K¨ahler moduli space and hence they are just as generic as smooth Calabi-Yau theories, which simply correspond to other regions. Furthermore, these orbifold regions are adjacent to smooth Calabi-Yau regions, but turning on expectation values for twist fields does not immediately resolve the singularities and move one into the Calabi-Yau region. Rather, one must traverse the orbifold region by turning on an expectation value for a twist field until one reaches a wall of the smooth Calabi-Yau region. Then, if one goes further (for which there is no physical obstruction) one enters the region of smooth Calabi-Yau theories. This is a significant departure from the hitherto espoused description of orbifolds in string theory. 3) In the mirror manifold construction of [5], typically both the original Calabi-Yau space and its mirror are singular. Quite generally, there is more than one way of repairing these singularities to yield a smooth Calabi-Yau manifold, and the resulting smooth spaces can be topologically distinct. A natural question is: is one or some subset of these possible desingularizations (which are on equalfooting mathematically)singled out by string theory, or are all possible desingularizations realized by physical models? We show that each possible desingularization to a smooth Calabi-Yau manifold has its own region in the fully enlarged K¨ahler moduli space. (In fact, these particular regions constitute what we call the partially enlarged K¨ahler moduli space.) 4) As remarked earlier, and as will be one of our main foci, the present work estab- lishes the veracity of the long suspected belief that string theory admits physically smooth processes which can result in a change of the topology of spacetime. Some of the regions 3 in the enlarged K¨ahler moduli space correspond to the complexified K¨ahler cones of topo- logically distinct smooth Calabi-Yau manifolds. Since we show that there is no physical obstruction to deforming our theories by truly marginal operators which take us smoothly from one region to another, we see that we can change the topology of spacetime in a physically smooth manner. Furthermore, there is nothing at all exotic about such pro- cesses. They correspond to the most basic kind of deformation to which one can subject a conformal field theory. This should be contrasted to the situation where one can change the topology of a Calabi-Yau manifold by passing through a conifold point in the moduli space as studied in [11]. In such a process one necessarily encounters singularities. Our approach to establishing these results [8], as mentioned, relies heavily on prop- erties of mirror manifolds originally established in [5]. These will be reviewed in the next section. Basically, mirror symmetry has established that a given conformal field theory may have more than one geometrical realization as a nonlinear ?-model with a Calabi-Yau target space. Two totally different Calabi-Yau spaces can give rise to isomorphic confor- mal theories (with the isomorphism being given by a change of sign of a certain charge). One important implication of this result is that any physical observable in the underlying conformal theory has two geometrical interpretations — one on each of the associated Calabi-Yau spaces. Furthermore, a one parameter family of conformal field theories of this sort likewise has two geometrical interpretations in terms of a family of Calabi-Yau spaces and in terms of a mirror family of Calabi-Yau spaces. The mirror manifold phe- nomenon can be an extremely powerful physical tool because certain questions which are hard to analyze in one geometrical interpretation are far easier to address on the mirror. For instance, as shown in [5], certain observables which have an extremely complicated geometrical realization on one of the Calabi-Yau spaces (involving an infinite series of in- stanton corrections, for example) have an equally simple geometrical interpretation on the mirror Calabi-Yau space (involving a single calculable integral over the space). For the question of topology change, and more generally, the question of the struc- ture of Calabi-Yau moduli space, we make use of mirror manifolds in the following way. The picture we are presenting implies that under mirror symmetry the complex structure moduli space of Y is mapped to the enlarged K¨ahler moduli space of X (and vice versa). From this we conclude that for any point in the enlarged K¨ahler moduli space of X we can find a corresponding point in the complex structure moduli space of Y such that correla- tion functions of corresponding observables are identically equal since these points should correspond to isomorphic conformal theories. By choosing representative points which lie 4

Fisica PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS: as Applied to Chemistry and Chemical Physics  CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS DONALD D. FITTS PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS as Applied to Chemistry and Chemical Physics This text presents a rigorous mathematical account of the principles of quantum mechanics, in particular as applied to chemistry and chemical physics. Applications are used as illustrations of the basic theory. The first two chapters serve as an introduction to quantum theory, although it is assumed that the reader has been exposed to elementary quantum mechanics as part of an undergraduate physical chemistry or atomic physics course. Following a discussion of wave motion leading to Schro¨dinger’s wave mech- anics, the postulates of quantum mechanics are presented along with the essential mathematical concepts and techniques. The postulates are rigorously applied to the harmonic oscillator, angular momentum, the hydrogen atom, the variation method, perturbation theory, and nuclear motion. Modern theoretical concepts such as hermitian operators, Hilbert space, Dirac notation, and ladder operators are introduced and used throughout. This advanced text is appropriate for beginning graduate students in chem- istry, chemical physics, molecular physics, and materials science. A native of the state of New Hampshire, Donald Fitts developed an interest in chemistry at the age of eleven. He was awarded an A.B. degree, magna cum laude with highest honors in chemistry, in 1954 from Harvard University and a Ph.D. degree in chemistry in 1957 from Yale University for his theoretical work with John G. Kirkwood. After one-year appointments as a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, Uni- versity of Amsterdam, and as a Research Fellow at Yale’s Chemistry Depart- ment, he joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, rising to the rank of Professor of Chemistry. In Penn’s School of Arts and Sciences, Professor Fitts also served as Acting Dean for one year and as Associate Dean and Director of the Graduate Division for fifteen years. His sabbatical leaves were spent in Britain as a NATO Senior Science Fellow at Imperial College, London, as an Academic Visitor in Physical Chemistry, University of Oxford, and as a Visiting Fellow at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He is the author of two other books, Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics (1962) and Vector Analysis in Chemistry (1974), and has published research articles on the theory of optical rotation, statistical mechanical theory of transport processes, nonequilibrium thermodynamics, molecular quantum mechanics, theory of liquids, intermolecular forces, and surface phenomena.

They are a lightly edited version of notes I handed out while teaching Physics 8.962, the graduate course in GR at MIT, during the Spring of 1996. Al- though they are appropriately called \lecture notes", the level of detail is fairly high, either including all necessary steps or leaving gaps that can readily be  lled in by the reader. Never- theless, there are various ways in which these notes di er from a textbook; most importantly, they are not organized into short sections that can be approached in various orders, but are meant to be gone through from start to  nish. A special e ort has been made to maintain a conversational tone, in an attempt to go slightly beyond the bare results themselves and into the context in which they belong. The primary question facing any introductory treatment of general relativity is the level of mathematical rigor at which to operate. There is no uniquely proper solution, as di erent students will respond with di erent levels of understanding and enthusiasm to di erent approaches. Recognizing this, I have tried to provide something for everyone. The lectures do not shy away from detailed formalism (as for example in the introduction to manifolds), but also attempt to include concrete examples and informal discussion of the concepts under consideration. As these are advertised as lecture notes rather than an original text, at times I have shamelessly stolen from various existing books on the subject (especially those by Schutz, Wald, Weinberg, and Misner, Thorne and Wheeler). My philosophy was never to try to seek originality for its own sake; however, originality sometimes crept in just because I thought I could be more clear than existing treatments. None of the substance of the material in these notes is new; the only reason for reading them is if an individual reader  nds the explanations here easier to understand than those elsewhere. Time constraints during the actual semester prevented me from covering some topics in the depth which they deserved, an obvious example being the treatment of cosmology. If the time and motivation come to pass, I may expand and revise the existing notes; updated versions will be available at http://itp.ucsb.edu/~carroll/notes/. Of course I will appreciate having my attention drawn to any typographical or scienti c errors, as well as suggestions for improvement of all sorts. Numerous people have contributed greatly both to my own understanding of general relativity and to these notes in particular | too many to acknowledge with any hope of completeness. Special thanks are due to Ted Pyne, who learned the subject along with me, taught me a great deal, and collaborated on a predecessor to this course which we taught as a seminar in the astronomy department at Harvard. Nick Warner taught the graduate course at MIT which I took before ever teaching it, and his notes were (as comparison will iv reveal) an important in uence on these. George Field o ered a great deal of advice and encouragement as I learned the subject and struggled to teach it. Tam as Hauer struggled along with me as the teaching assistant for 8.962, and was an invaluable help. All of the students in 8.962 deserve thanks for tolerating my idiosyncrasies and prodding me to ever higher levels of precision. During the course of writing these notes I was supported by U.S. Dept. of Energy con- tract no. DE-AC02-76ER03069 and National Science Foundation grants PHY/92-06867 and PHY/94-07195. 
Fisica  This page intentionally left blank FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION Functional integration successfully entered physics as path integrals in the 1942 Ph.D. dissertation of Richard P. Feynman, but it made no sense at all as a math- ematical definition. Cartier and DeWitt-Morette have created, in this book, a new approach to functional integration. The close collaboration between a math- ematician and a physicist brings a unique perspective to this topic. The book is self-contained: mathematical ideas are introduced, developed, generalized, and applied. In the authors’ hands, functional integration is shown to be a robust, user-friendly, and multi-purpose tool that can be applied to a great variety of situations, for example systems of indistinguishable particles, caustics-analysis, superanalysis, and non-gaussian integrals. Problems in quantum field theory are also considered. In the final part the authors outline topics that can profitably be pursued using material already presented. Pierre Cartier is a mathematician with an extraordinarily wide range of interests and expertise. He has been called “un homme de la Renaissance.” He is Emeritus Director of Research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France, and a long-term visitor of the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques. From 1981 to 1989, he was a senior researcher at the Ecole Poly- technique de Paris, and, between 1988 and 1997, held a professorship at the Ecole Normale Sup´erieure. He is a member of the Soci´et´e Math´ematique de France, the American Mathematical Society, and the Vietnamese Mathematical Society. C´ecileDeWitt-Morette is the Jane and Roland Blumberg Centen- nial Professor in Physics, Emerita, at the University of Texas at Austin. She is a member of the American and European Physical Societies, and a Mem- bre d’Honneur de la Soci´et´eFran¸caise de Physique. DeWitt-Morette’s interest in functional integration began in 1948. In F. J. Dyson’s words, “she was the first of the younger generation to grasp the full scope and power of the Feynman path integral approach in physics.” She is co-author with Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat of the two-volume book Analysis, Manifolds and Physics, a standard text first published in 1977, which is now in its seventh edition. She is the author of 100 publications in various areas of theoretical physics and has edited 28 books. She has lectured, worldwide, in many institutions and summer schools on topics related to functional integration. CAMBRIDGE MONOGRAPHS ON MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS General editors: P. V. Landsho?, D. R.

La incorporación de la informática como herramienta en el proceso educativo, acompañada de un enfoque pedagógico adecuado que evite un efecto negativo sobre los estudiantes, ha ampliado las posibilidades de investigación en Educación en Física. Teniendo en cuenta las dificulta- des que se plantean en la enseñanza de la física respecto de la incidencia negativa de los preconceptos en el aprendizaje, es que se pretende lo- grar no solamente un cambio conceptual, sino también un cambio en el aspecto procedimental y, sobre todo, actitudinal. Así, la propuesta pedagógica contempla una reformulación de los roles de docentes y alumnos, fomentando de esta manera, además de la creatividad, el pensamiento reflexivo y el juicio crítico, como así también la investigación científica. Para la selección de temas a abordar se tuvieron en cuenta aspectos tales como: • Su incidencia en los programas de Física en los distintos niveles de enseñanza. • La factibilidad de simulación de fenómenos en las mayorías de las computadoras de los centros de enseñanza de la región, en los distintos niveles. • La aplicabilidad de un lenguaje informático que posibilite la obten- ción de pantallas con resoluciones adecuadas, a los efectos de obtener visiones de textos y gráficos y desarrollar programas animados y sono- ros. • La posibilidad de aplicación en otras disciplinas de nuestra facultad (Facultad de Ingeniería de la Universidad Nacional de Entre Ríos – FIUNER). • La posibilidad de lograr softwares que permitan la adecuación de metodologías óptimas para el marco educativo. Por esto, se decidió dirigir la investigación al campo de la mecánica y la electricidad, diseñando modelos y dispositivos con relación a los Sis- temas: MODELIZACION COMPUTARIZADA DE SISTEMAS FISICOS.

Metodología Las hipótesis que guiaron este trabajo, convergente con los resulta- dos de otras investigaciones en el campo de la Educación en Física, pue- den sintetizarse en:  -Adoptar una tecnología informática para el diseño y desarrollo de mo- delos físicos favorece la actividad científica aplicable al proceso de ense- ñanza-aprendizaje. -La creación de modelos físicos y matemáticos mediante la selección adecuada de variables favorece la conceptualización de leyes y principios físicos. En el diseño metodológico del proyecto se fijaron las siguientes Fa- ses: 1 - Establecimiento de la infraestructura del laboratorio. 2 - Iniciación de una biblioteca de programas. 3 - Selección de temas a abordar. 4 - Diseño de modelos y dispositivos (hardware). 5 - Programación computarizada (software). 6 - Optimización de modelos. 7 - Elaboración de material didáctico. 8 - Experiencias-piloto. 9 – Establecimiento de conclusiones. Esas diferentes fases, que no deben entenderse en un sentido secuencial sino como actividades que conformaron un entramado, impli- caron delimitar distintas etapas adecuadas convenientemente de manera de obtener la validación de las hipótesis planteadas. El diseño de los instrumentos para la aproximación a posibles mode- los o teorías implícitas se realizó a partir de la confluencia de distintas fuentes de información: análisis del desarrollo histórico de las ideas cien- tíficas en este campo, análisis de bibliografía disponible sobre concepcio- nes alternativas en el dominio en estudio, entrevistas extensas y tests. Las observaciones llevadas a cabo en un primer momento a través de distin- MARCOS F. y col. (157-178) 161 Ciencia, Docencia y Tecnología Nº 30, Año XVI, mayo de 2005 tos medios (internet, revistas de divulgación científicas, memorias de con- gresos y reuniones, etc.) permitieron concluir que no existían estudios destacables de ideas científicas vinculadas con la hipótesis principal. El relevamiento del material bibliográfico utilizado para desarrollar los pro- gramas de Física en los distintos niveles de enseñanza dio lugar a la elec- ción de temas con los que se configuraron los Sistemas Físicos-proble- mas, presentados en este proyecto. Se utilizó como técnica el estudio de caso, realizado a través de entrevistas extensas, observaciones en clase y registros escritos de actividades propuestas a los alumnos de la facultad. También se efectuaron entrevistas a investigadores en el campo de la modelización y de metodologías de la enseñanza, y para la aplicación pi- loto de los instrumentos de diagnóstico se diseñaron cuestionarios abier- tos y cuestionarios de ponderación de enunciados a los efectos de de- tectar las dificultades que presentaban los alumnos en la interpretación de conceptos físicos. En la etapa de diseño de modelos y dispositivos, se elaboró un pro- grama con los temas a abordar, se analizó y concretó la construcción de modelos factibles de ser simulados en la computadora y se procedió a su optimización de manera de permitir el análisis simultáneo de fenómenos físicos ideales y favorecer de esa manera la elaboración de software y hardware. Finalmente, la aplicación del modelo matemático para cada sis- tema y los dispositivos creados para interactuar con aquéllos por medio de la interfase, permitió que alumnos de distintas instituciones educativas llevaran a cabo experiencias-piloto y analizaran la factibilidad de su apli- cación. II. Resultados y discusión II.1. Sistema masa-resorte El diseño del modelo matemático de este sistema impulsó la tarea de realizar estudios tendientes a lograr pantallas con diferentes resolucio- nes que permitieran la obtención de aquéllas que ofrecieran una mejor visión de las posibilidades textuales, gráficas y sonoras. Se desarrollaron programas animados incorporando textos, produciendo ventanas y graficando funciones. Se analizaron sistemas físicos conformados por re- sortes de diferentes constantes elásticas y cuerpos de distintas masas, lo que dio lugar a datos experimentales que fueron incorporados al modelo MODELIZACION COMPUTARIZADA DE SISTEMAS FISICOS.

Fisica   Quantum Physics    1         Running head: QUANTUM PHYSICS                     What Does Quantum Physics Have To Do With Behavior Disorders?         David B. Center     Georgia State University                                              Center, D. B. (1999).  National FORUM of Applied Educational Research Journal  -   Elect ronic, 12E(3) , [on line] http://www.nationalforum.com     Quantum Physics    2     Abstract   Human agency, as a causal factor in behavior, should be taken into account in any complete  model of behavior.  Human agency is historically tied to the issue of consciousness and its role in  behavior.  Thus, to argue that consciousness plays a causal role in behavior requires that a  plausible explanation of consciousness be articulated, if the assertion is to be more than mere  speculation.  This paper discusses of one line of current hypothesi zing about the nature of mind  and consciousness.  The view examined proposes that consciousness or mind is an emergent  property of a biological process that can be explained in physical terms.  The process described is  the Frohlich - style Bose - Einstein cond ensate, which appears to be capable of producing a macro - quantum effect in a biological system.  The process is thought to operate at the level of neurons in  the brain.  If consciousness can be explained as a natural process with a physical basis in the br ain,  there are several implications for the study of human behavior in general and children with  behavior disorders in particular.  The first implication is for a change in our epistemology to a  philosophy similar to that of scientific realism.  The second  implication is for an expansion of our  concept of causation in behavior to include consciousness as a potential causal agent.  The third  implication is for a conceptual change in the framework employed in behavior change efforts to  emphasize a cooperative  approach rather than a teacher - centered approach.         Quantum Physics    3     What Does Quantum Physics Have To Do With Behavior Disorders?   David B. Center     The answer to the above question is, of necessity, both complex and speculative. One perennial  question that virtually a ll conceptions of behavior must address is that of the role of mind or of  consciousness in human behavior. Much of Western thought has been influenced by the  Newtonian worldview of classical physics. The successes of classical physics reinforced a  material istic and mechanistic approach to the study of all kinds of phenomena, including behavior.   Bergmann (1940) pointed out that at the end of the nineteenth century psychology was still  struggling with its metaphysical heritage from philosophy.  At that time,  psychologists turned to  the logico - positivistic movement that was gaining momentum in the physical sciences. One early  example of psychology’s adoption of the logico - positivistic approach was Watsonian behaviorism.  The most obvious contemporary example of  the classical approach to explaining human behavior  is the environmental determinism of the radical behaviorists (Skinner, 1972).  Radical behaviorists  see no role for mind or consciousness in human behavior and assert that it is a mentalistic illusion.    Cognitivists, on the other hand, rooted in the classical tradition but less radical than the  behaviorists, see mind or consciousness as playing an important role in human behavior.  Many  cognitivists believe that consciousness or mind is a computational pr ocess like a computer  program or software running in a biological computer, i.e., wetware (Johnson - Laird, 1988).   These cognitivists appear to be very much in the classical camp since they believe that thinking  can be reduced to a set of computational algo rithms.    Currently, there are some very sophisticated efforts to provide an explanation of  consciousness from a classical approach based on computing models.  However, mathematical    Quantum Physics    4     physicist Roger Penrose (1994) argued convincingly that no amount of comput ing power is  capable of accounting for non - computational effects such as understanding.  In Penrose’s own  words, “I am contending that the faculty of human understanding lies beyond any computational  scheme whatever” (p.367).  Chemist Graham Cairns - Smith ( 1996) suggested that another non - computational faculty is the essential quality of consciousness and says,  “It seems to me that it is  precisely the element of feeling in conscious thought which makes it conscious” (p. 154).  It  appears that the two facult ies proposed as essential features of consciousness by Cairns - Smith and  Penrose may be different aspects of a more complex phenomenon resulting from an interaction of  these two faculties.  Neurologist Antonio Damasio (1994) offered evidence that both the  i ntellectual process and affective process are linked and dependent upon one another.  Damasio  demonstrated that when the link between thought and feeling is severed, as happens with some  types of brain damage, reasoning and decision - making are impaired.    P hilosopher John Searle (1992) offered another perspective on the same issue.  Searle  argued that a duplication of consciousness and thought based on computational algorithms, such  as the attempts being made by artificial intelligence researchers, could not  work because  conscious thought, like digestion, is a natural process.  Computation is a human artifact that is  observer - relative and not intrinsic to the natural world.  Thus, a computational model would be a  mathematical representation of a natural proce ss and, no matter how perfect the model, it would  still be just a simulation or representation.  Searle proposed this thought experiment about  simulations: suppose that you write a computer program that perfectly simulates the process of  digestion. Now ask  yourself, can this simulation digest a piece of pizza?  Likewise, he argued,  neither can a computational simulation of thinking think, because thought, like digestion, is a  natural process.     Quantum Physics    5      Psychiatrist I. N. Marshall (1989) discussed two properties of c onsciousness that cannot  be explained by classical physics.  These two properties are unity and complexity.  He asserted  that consciousness is a complex phenomenon that cannot be localized to any specific site in the  brain.  Thus, consciousness must depend  upon processes extending over separate areas of the  brain. Further, Marshall argued that the unity of consciousness implies that areas of the brain  giving rise to consciousness have a single identity.  However, the principle of classical locality in  physi cs assumes that spatially separated parts of a process have different identities.  Hence,  Marshall asserted “...states of consciousness are not describable by classical physics” (p. 74).   “Therefore the substrate of consciousness is assumed not to be a cla ssical system” (p. 78).   Marshall (1989) summarized his analysis in the following statement:    “The general assumption of classical mechanics is that any complex system can be  reductively analyzed into smaller parts having separate identities and only local   interactions. ...The classical assumption, which pervades our whole technology and  culture, has broken down in quantum mechanics...A kind of “relational holism”  pervades quantum mechanics (Teller, 1986).  But these discoveries have not been  fully assimila ted into the prevailing intellectual orthodoxy.” (p. 78).       If Marshall’s analysis is accepted, the search for a physical basis for consciousness must  look for a biological process that can produce a macro - quantum effect.  Cairns - Smith (1996)  proposed a set of criteria to use in evaluating possible quantum - based theories of consciousness.   His proposal consisted of four necessary features:   1.  The theory must be able to explain consciousness as a physical effect.   2.  The physical effect must meet the requir ement of evolutionary accessibility; i.e., it has a   high probability of arising, in rudimentary form, from natural variations in physical   structures.

Fisica ARELATIVISTIC, CAUSAL ACCOUNT OF A SPIN MEASUREMENT Anthony Challinor, Anthony Lasenby, Stephen Gull and Chris Doran MRAO, Cavendish Laboratory, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB3 OHE, UK. November 15, 1996 Abstract An objective account of the action of a Stern-Gerlach apparatus on spin- 1 2 particles is given, using the Dirac equation. This generalizes earlier work on a causal interpretation of the Pauli equation to the relativistic domain, leading to a more natural choice for the current in the model. 1 Introduction Dewdney et al. [1, 2] have described the action of an inhomogenous magnetic eld on an uncharged spin- 1 2 particle, as in a Stern-Gerlachtype spin measurement. Their aim was to demonstrate that there is a causal interpretation of quantum mech- anics which is not only consistent with the equations of quantum mechanics, but which quantitatively reproduces the results of measurements made on ensembles of identically prepared systems. According to suchaninterpretation wemay assign well-dened trajectories and spin vectors to particles and study how these interact with the apparatus during the course of a measurement. For a spin measurement, the conventional collapse of the wavefunction onto eigenstates of the spin operators along the eld direction is replaced by a continuous evolution of the particle's spin vector towards either alignmentoranti-alignment with the eld direction. Dewd- ney et al. interpret this alignment as the consequence of `quantum torques' which act in addition to the usual spin precession in the magnetic eld. These quantum torques depend on the wavefunction and hence are sensitive to the whole experi- mental context. In this letter weprovide a fully relativistic account of a similar spin measurement. It is well known that the current employed by Dewdney et al. is inconsistent with that obtained from Dirac theory in the non-relativistic limit, the two diering bya term in the curl of the spin vector [3, 4]. However, the qualitative results of Dewd- ney et al. for the behaviour of the streamlines and the spin vector coincide with our 1 predictions in the non-relativistic case. Our results demonstrate that the determin- istic evolution of the wavefunction suces to account for the discrete outcomes of a quantum spin measurement. We do not need the relativistic analogue of Bohm/de Broglie theory in order to accept the validity of these results. Besides dealing with a well-dened current, a relativistic treatment is necessary as a foundation for future work extending these ideas to correlated spin measurements made over spacelike intervals, as in EPR-type experiments, so as to take issues of locality properly into account. The treatment presented here is, at the rst quantised level, appropriate to scattering from arbitrarily large magnetic eld gradients. However we shall see that pair production becomes signicantinsuch cases, demanding ultimately a eld- theoretic treatment. With an appropriate change in the electromagnetic interaction term, the present treatment could be extended to model the motion of an electron in an inhomogeneous external magnetic eld. This would shed light on Bohr's state- ment that no measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron could be made, by simply observing the beam splitting on passage through such a eld (see e.g. appendix to [5]). In the extension of Bohm's original ideas to include the concept of spin [6], the Pauli spinor is parameterised as ji = Re i =2   cos(=2)e i=2 isin(=2)e ;i=2 ! (1.1) where f;;;; g are Euler angles describing the state of rotation of the particle. This spinor is assumed to evolve according to the Pauli equation, i~@ t ji = ; ~ 2 2m r 2 ji;^Bji;; (1.2) where  is the anomalous magnetic moment of the particle. The particle velocity v is dened by J = v,where = hji and the current J has components J k given by J k = i~ 2m (h@ k ji;hj@ k i): (1.3) Note that no spatial integration is implied by the use of bra-ket notation. The spin-vector s has components s k given by s k = ~ 2 hj^ k ji = ~ 2 (sin sin;;sin cos;;cos ) ;; (1.4) where the f^ k g are the Pauli spin operators. The Pauli equation can now be used to determine the equation of motion for the spin vector along a chosen streamline. The resulting equation diers from the classical equation by the inclusion of the `quantum torque' which is a non-local term involving spatial derivatives of the spin current s. 2 Using these denitions of s and v, Dewdney et al. calculate the integral curves of the velocityvector (streamlines) and the Euler angles f;;;; g as functions of spatial position and time for a Gaussian wavepacket which is localised along the eld direction. They nd that the wavefunction evolves in just the way required to give either alignmentoranti-alignment with the eld direction. Our treatment of the relativistic problem uses the Dirac equation expressed in the spacetime algebra (STA) formalism of Hestenes [7], whichwe brie y review in the next section before applying it to the spin measurement in Sections 3 and 4. Webelieve that the STAisnotonlyapowerful computational tool for discussing quantum mechanics but one which brings genuine new insightinto the geometric structure of Dirac theory, implying far-reaching consequences for the quantum the- ory of measurement. Of course, the results presented here are independent of the representation in which the underlying theory is expressed, but webelieve their in- terpretation is most transparent when considered in the STA. We use natural units (c =1;;~ = 1) except when presenting the results of our simulations. 2 Dirac Theory in the STA The spacetime algebra [7, 8] is a real, geometric (Cliord) algebra [9] on Minkowski spacetime. Vectors a;;b are equipped with a single product that is associative (and distributiveover addition), whichwe denote ab. Itisconvenienttointroduce four orthonormal basis vectors f   g,  =0;;1;;2;;3, satisfying        1 2 (      +       )=  =diag(+;;;);; (2.1) where   0 is a timelikeunitvector. The algebra of the vectors f   g is the same as that of Dirac's ^ -matrices, but they now form an orthonormal basis for spacetime, rather than the four components of a single vector in an internal `spin-space'. By repeated multiplication we generate a basis of sixteen elements for the STA, 1 f   g f k ;;i k g fi   g i 1 scalar 4vectors 6bivectors 4 trivectors 1 pseudoscalar;; where  k    k   0 and i    0   1   2   3 =  1  2  3 : (2.2) The grade-4 element i is the highest-grade element in the space, and i 2 = ;1. However, unlike the uninterpreted scalar imaginary used in conventional quantum mechanics, whichwe denote by j,itnow has a denite geometric interpretation. The timelikebivectors f k g obey the same algebraic relations as the Pauli spin matrices, but in the STA they represent an orthonormal frame of `relative' vectors in the Euclidean 3-space relative to an observer whose 4-velocityis  0 .We shall take this 3 frame as our laboratory frame. To describe observations made in this inertial system we make use of the space-time split: if x is a vector labelling an event in spacetime, this event is seen to occur at time t and position x where x  0 = t + x = x  0 + x^  0 : (2.3) The `relative' vector x is denoted in bold typeface to distinguish it from (proper) vectors. We denote the derivative with respect to spacetime position by r. This operator has the space-time split   0 r = @ t + r,wherer is the usual gradient operator in three-dimensional space, r  k @ k . Two useful operations are reversion, denoted by a tilde, which reverses the order of 4-vectors in an STA expression, and Hermitian conjugation, denoted by a dagger, which reverses the order of relative3-vectors in a non-relativistic expression. Angled brackets h i k are used to denote the grade-k part of the enclosed expression, with the subscript zero suppressed when discussing the scalar part. Our notation and conventions follow those in [8, 10]. We shall need the STA representation of the Faraday tensor, in order to discuss the interaction of an anomalous magnetic moment with the electromagnetic eld. The components F  may be assembled with the set of bivectors f   ^   g to form the Faradaybivector F, given by F r^A = 1 2    ^   F  : (2.4) This has the space-time split F = E + iB,whereE and B are the electric and magnetic elds in the   0 system. The even sub-algebra of the STA comprises a representation for the Dirac spinor  , allowing a reformulation of Dirac theory in the STA. This formalism and some applications to electron physics have been discussed at length in [11], which includes a preliminary summary of the results presented here. In this representation wemay write [12]  =(e i ) 1 2 R;; (2.5) where  is a positive scale factor and R is a spacetime rotation (rotor) satisfying R ~ R = 1. A direct method of translation between matrix-based approaches and the spacetime algebra of Hestenes is given in Ref. [10]. In the STA, the Dirac equation may be written as [7] r i 3 ;eA = m   0 : (2.6) The components of the Dirac current assemble with the f   g vectors to give the conserved frame-free current J =    0 ~  . The integral curves of J dene a set of non-intersecting streamlines in spacetime, whose tangents are always future-pointing 4 timelikevectors. According to the standard Born interpretation of quantum mech- anics, J 0 (x;;t) gives the probability of locating the particle at position x and time t. The conservation of J implies that J 0 (x 0 ;;t 0 )d 3 x 0 = J 0 (x 1 ;;t 1 )d 3 x 1 ;; (2.7) where (t 0 ;;x 0 )and(t 1 ;;x 1 ) are joined by a streamline. The density J 0 thus  ows along the  ux tubes formed by adjacent streamlines, without `leaking' out. For this reason, the streamlines are a useful tool for studying the  ow of density in dynamic situations, independent of whether one accepts Bohm/de Broglie theory or any other particulate interpretation. It is in this spirit that we plot streamlines for the spin measurement in our simulations. The components h   j^   ^  5 j i of the spin current, like those of the Dirac current, assemble with the f   g vectors to give the frame-free spin current s     3 ~  . The above discussion suggests that the role of the Dirac matrices in the theory is simply to dene an orthonormal frame of vectors. It follows that claims of dynam- ical consequences based solely on their algebraic properties are questionable. One such example is the deduction that the measured velocity of an electron will always yield the speed of light (because the eigenvalues of the `velocity' operators ^  0 ^  k are 1). To the extent that wemay sensibly dene a particle velocity v in the Dirac theory, consistency with the laws of quantum mechanics requires that the velocity be in the direction of the Dirac current, i.e. J = v. If not, particles would end up at positions with probabilities inconsistent with those derived from the Dirac (charge) current. Similar arguments may apply to spin measurements, where the anti-commutation properties of the Dirac matrices (or, non-relativistically,thePauli matrices) are usually taken to imply that no two components of the spin maybe known simultaneously. Our starting point is a form of the Dirac equation which describes an electrically- neutral spin- 1 2 particle of anomalous magnetic moment . In the conventional rep- resentation this equation may be written as [13] (j^   @  ; 1 2 ^  F  )j (x)i = mj (x)i: (2.8) The operators ^  are dened in terms of the Dirac ^ -matrices by ^   1 2 j [^   ;; ^   ]: (2.9) Translating equation (2.8) into the STAwe nd the equation r i 3 ;F i  3 = m   0 : (2.10) Note that there are some inconsistencies in the literature with the sign both of F and the term containing it in the modied Dirac equation. For example, compare Section 9.11 of Greiner [13], with equation (10.81) of Bjorken and Drell [14]. For 5

September29,1997 Abstract We present new, massive, non-ghost solutions for the Dirac eld coupled self-consistently to gravity.We employ a gauge-theoretic formulation of grav- ity which automatically identies the spin of the Dirac eld with the torsion of the gauge elds. Homogeneity of the eld observables requires that the spatial sections be  at. Expanding and collapsing singular solutions are given, as well as a solution which expands from a singularity before recollapsing. Torsion eects are only important while the Compton wavelength of the Dirac eld is larger than the Hubble radius. We study the motion of spinning point- particles in the background of the expanding solution. The anisotropy due to the torsion is manifest in the particle trajectories. 1 Introduction TheproblemofndingcosmologicalsolutionsforaDiraceldcoupledtogravityin aself-consistentmannerhasbeenconsideredbyseveralauthors,forexample[1]{[10].

Theidenticationoftorsionwiththespinofthemattereld[15,16,17]follows naturally from the gauge-theoretic approach to gravity[18].A new approachto gauge theory gravity(GTG) was developed in [19, 20]. In this approach gravita- tionaleectsare describedbya pair of gauge eldsdened overa  at Minkowski background spacetime. The gauge elds ensure the invariance of the theory un- der arbitrary local displacementsand rotations in the background spacetime. All physicalpredictionsareextractedinagauge-invariantmanner,thusensuring that the background spacetime plays no dynamic role in the physics.

Thesearederivedfromaminimally-coupled,gauge- invariantactionandaretheanaloguesoftheEinstein-Cartan-Diracequations. The Einstein-Dirac equations, which describe a Dirac eld coupled to gravity through the(symmetrised)stress-energy tensor only, cannot be derivedfroma minimally- coupled action. This is a compelling reason to regard the Einstein-Cartan-Dirac equationsasbeingmorefundamental. Thesolutions presentedherearehomogeneous atthelevelofthegravitational gaugeelds.

Psychrometry is concerned with determination of the properties of gas-vapor mixtures. The air-water vapor system is by far the system most commonly encountered. Principles involved in determining the properties of other systems are the same as with air-water vapor, with one major exception. Whereas the psychrometric ratio (ratio of heat-transfer coefficient to product of mass-transfer coefficient and humid heat, terms defined in the following subsection) for the air-water system can be taken as 1, the ratio for other systems in general does not equal 1. This has the effect of making the adiabatic-saturation temperature different from the wet-bulb temperature. Thus, for systems other than air-water vapor, calculation of psychrometric and drying problems is compli- cated by the necessity for point-to-point calculation of the tempera- ture of the evaporating surface. For example, for the air-water system the temperature of the evaporating surface will be constant during the constant-rate drying period even though temperature and humidity of the gas stream change. For other systems, the temperature of the evaporating surface would change. TERMINOLOGY Terminology and relationships pertinent to psychrometry are: Absolute humidity H equals the pounds of water vapor carried by 1 lb of dry air. If ideal-gas behavior is assumed, H = M w p/[M a (P ? p)], where M w = molecular weight of water; M a = molecular weight of air; p = partial pressure of water vapor, atm; and P = total pressure, atm. When the partial pressure p of water vapor in the air at a given tem- perature equals the vapor pressure of water p s at the same tempera- ture, the air is saturated and the absolute humidity is designated the saturation humidity H s . Percentage absolute humidity (percentage saturation) is defined as the ratio of absolute humidity to saturation humidity and is given by 100 H/H s = 100p(P ? p s )/[p s (P ? p)]. Percentage relative humidity is defined as the partial pressure of water vapor in air divided by the vapor pressure of water at the given temperature. Thus RH = 100p/p s . Dew point, or saturation temperature, is the temperature at which a given mixture of water vapor and air is saturated, for example, the temperature at which water exerts a vapor pressure equal to the partial pressure of water vapor in the given mixture. Humid heat c s is the heat capacity of 1 lb of dry air and the mois- ture it contains. For most engineering calculations, c s = 0.24 + 0.45H, where 0.24 and 0.45 are the heat capacities of dry air and water vapor, respectively, and both are assumed constant. Humid volume is the volume in cubic feet of 1 lb of dry air and the water vapor it contains. Saturated volume is the humid volume when the air is saturated. Wet-bulb temperature is the dynamic equilibrium temperature attained by a water surface when the rate of heat transfer to the sur- face by convection equals the rate of mass transfer away from the sur- face. At equilibrium, if negligible change in the dry-bulb temperature is assumed, a heat balance on the surface is k g ?(p s ? p) = h c (t ? t w ) (12-1a) where k g = mass-transfer coefficient, lb/(h?ft 2 ?atm); ?=latent heat of vaporization, Btu/lb; p s = vapor pressure of water at wet-bulb temper- ature, atm; p = partial pressure of water vapor in the environment, atm; h c = heat-transfer coefficient, Btu/(h?ft 2 ?°F); t = temperature of air-water vapor mixture (dry-bulb temperature), °F; and t w = wet-bulb temperature, °F. Under ordinary conditions the partial pressure and vapor pressure are small relative to the total pressure, and the wet- bulb equation can be written in terms of humidity differences as H s ? H = (h c /?k?)(t ? t w ) (12-1b) where k?=lb/(h?ft 2 ) (unit humidity difference) = (M a /M w )k g = 1.6k g . Adiabatic-Saturation Temperature, or Constant-Enthalpy Lines If a stream of air is intimately mixed with a quantity of water at a temperature t s in an adiabatic system, the temperature of the air will drop and its humidity will increase. If t s is such that the air leaving the system is in equilibrium with the water, t s will be the adiabatic- saturation temperature, and the line relating the temperature and humidity of the air is the adiabatic-saturation line. The equation for the adiabatic-saturation line is H s ? H = (c s /?)(t ? t s ) (12-2) RELATION BETWEEN WET-BULB AND  ADIABATIC-SATURATION TEMPERATURES Experimentally it has been shown that for air-water systems the value of h c /k?c s , the psychrometric ratio, is approximately equal to 1. Under these conditions the wet-bulb temperatures and adiabatic- saturation temperatures are substantially equal and can be used inter- changeably. The difference between adiabatic-saturation temperature and wet-bulb temperature increases with increasing humidity, but this effect is unimportant for most engineering calculations. An empirical formula for wet-bulb temperature determination of moist air at atmos- pheric pressure is presented by Liley [Int. J. of Mechanical Engineer- ing Education, vol. 21, No. 2 (1993)]. For systems other than air-water vapor, the value of h c /k?c s may dif- fer appreciably from unity, and the wet-bulb and adiabatic-saturation temperatures are no longer equal. For these systems the psychromet- ric ratio may be obtained by determining h c /k? from heat- and mass- transfer analogies such as the Chilton-Colburn analogy [Ind. Eng. Chem., 26, 1183 (1934)]. For low humidities this analogy gives = c s H20898H20899 2/3 (12-3) where c s = humid heat, Btu/(lb?°F); µ=viscosity, lb/(ft?h); ?=density, lb/ft 3 ; D v = diffusivity, ft 2 /h; and k = thermal conductivity, Btu/(h?ft 2 ) (°F/ft). All properties should be evaluated for the gas mixture. For the case of flow past cylinders, such as a wet-bulb ther- mometer, Bedingfield and Drew [Ind. Eng. Chem., 42, 1164 (1950)] obtained a correlation for their data on sublimation of cylinders into air and for the data of others on wet-bulb thermometers. For wet-bulb thermometers in air they give h c /k?=0.294(µ/?D v ) 0.56 (12-4) where the nomenclature is identical to that in Eq. (12-3). For evapo- ration into gases other than air, Eq. (12-3) with an exponent of 0.56 would apply. Application of these equations is illustrated in Example 1. µ/?D v H5007 c s µ/k h c H5007 k? 12-3 PSYCHROMETRY* * The contribution of Eno Bagnoli, E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., to material that was used from the sixth edition is acknowledged. (Psychrometry) Example 1: Compare Wet-Bulb and Adiabatic-Saturation Temperatures For the air-water system at atmospheric pressure, the mea- sured values of dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures are 85 and 72°F respec- tively. Determine the absolute humidity and compare the wet-bulb temperature and adiabatic-saturation temperature. Assume that h c /k? is given by Eq. (12-4). Solution. For relatively dry air the Schmidt number µ/?D v is 0.60, and from Eq. (12-4) h c /k?=0.294(0.60) 0.56 = 0.221. At 72°F the vapor pressure of water is 20.07 mmHg, and the latent heat of vaporization is 1051.6 Btu/lb. From Eq. (12- 1b), [20.07/(760 ? 20.07)](18/29) ? H = (0.221/1051.6)(85 ? 72), or H = 0.0140 lb water/lb dry air. The humid heat is calculated as c s = 0.24 + 0.45(0.0140) = 0.246. The adiabatic-saturation temperature is obtained from Eq. (12-2) as H s ? 0.0140 = (0.246/1051.6)(85 ? t s ) Values of H s and t s are given by the saturation curve of the psychrometric chart, such as Fig. 12-2. By trial and error, t s = 72.1°F, or the adiabatic-saturation tem- perature is 0.1°F higher than the wet-bulb temperature. USE OF PSYCHROMETRIC CHARTS Three charts for the air-water vapor system are given as Figs. 12-1 to 12-3 for low-, medium-, and high-temperature ranges. Figure 12-4 shows a modified Grosvenor chart, which is more familiar to the chemical engineer. These charts are for an absolute pressure of 1 atm. The corrections required at pressures different from atmospheric are given in Table 12-2. Figure 12-5 shows a psychrometric chart for com- bustion products in air. The thermodynamic properties of moist air are given in Table 12-1. Examples Illustrating Use of Psychrometric Charts In these examples the following nomenclature is used: t = dry-bulb temperatures, °F t w = wet-bulb temperature, °F t d = dew-point temperature, °F H = moisture content, lb water/lb dry air ?H = moisture added to or rejected from the air stream, lb water/lb dry air h?=enthalpy at saturation, Btu/lb dry air D = enthalpy deviation, Btu/lb dry air h = h?+D = true enthalpy, Btu/lb dry air h w = enthalpy of water added to or rejected from the system, Btu/lb dry air q a = heat added to the system, Btu/lb dry air q r = heat removed from system, Btu/lb dry air Subscripts 1, 2, 3, etc., indicate entering and subsequent states. Example 2: Determination of Moist Air Properties Find the properties of moist air when the dry-bulb temperature is 80°F and the wet-bulb temperature is 67°F. Solution. Read directly from Fig. 12-2 (Fig. 12-6 shows the solution dia- grammatically). Moisture content H = 78 gr/lb dry air = 0.011 lb water/lb dry air Enthalpy at saturation h?=31.6 Btu/lb dry air Enthalpy deviation D =?0.1 Btu/lb dry air True enthalpy h = 31.5 Btu/lb dry air Specific volume v = 13.8 ft 3 /lb dry air Relative humidity = 51 percent Dew point t d = 60.3°F Example 3: Air Heating Air is heated by a steam coil from 30°F dry- bulb temperature and 80 percent relative humidity to 75°F dry-bulb tempera- ture. Find the relative humidity, wet-bulb temperature, and dew point of the heated air. Determine the quantity of heat added per pound of dry air. Solution. Reading directly from the psychrometric chart (Fig. 12-2), 12-4 PSYCHROMETRY, EVAPORATIVE COOLING, AND SOLIDS DRYING FIG. 12-1 Psychrometric chart—low temperatures. Barometric pressure, 29.92 inHg. To convert British thermal units per pound to joules per kilogram, multiply by 2326; to convert British thermal units per pound dry air-degree Fahrenheit to joules per kilogram-kelvin, multiply by 4186.8; and to convert cubic feet per pound to cubic meters per kilogram, multiply by 0.0624. Relative humidity = 15 percent Wet-bulb temperature = 51.5°F Dew point = 25.2°F The enthalpy of the inlet air is obtained from Fig. 12-2 as h 1 = h? 1 + D 1 = 10.1 + 0.06 = 10.16 Btu/lb dry air; at the exit, h 2 = h? 2 + D 2 = 21.1 ? 0.1 = 21 Btu/lb dry air. The heat added equals the enthalpy difference, or q a =?h = h 2 ? h 1 = 21 ? 10.16 = 10.84 Btu/lb dry air If the enthalpy deviation is ignored, the heat added q a is ?h = 21.1 ? 10.1 = 11 Btu/lb dry air, or the result is 1.5 percent high. Figure 12-7 shows the heating path on the psychrometric chart. Example 4: Evaporative Cooling Air at 95°F dry-bulb temperature and 70°F wet-bulb temperature contacts a water spray, where its relative humidity is increased to 90 percent. The spray water is recirculated; makeup water enters at 70°F. Determine exit dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb tempera- ture, change in enthalpy of the air, and quantity of moisture added per pound of dry air. Solution. Figure 12-8 shows the path on a psychrometric chart. The leaving dry-bulb temperature is obtained directly from Fig. 12-2 as 72.2°F. Since the spray water enters at the wet-bulb temperature of 70°F and there is no heat added to or removed from it, this is by definition an adiabatic process and there will be no change in wet-bulb temperature. The only change in enthalpy is that from the heat content of the makeup water. This can be demonstrated as fol- lows: Inlet moisture H 1 = 70 gr/lb dry air Exit moisture H 2 = 107 gr/lb dry air ?H = 37 gr/lb dry air Inlet enthalpy h 1 = h? 1 + D 1 = 34.1 ? 0.22 = 33.88 Btu/lb dry air Exit enthalpy h 2 = h? 2 + D 2 = 34.1 ? 0.02 = 34.08 Btu/lb dry air Enthalpy of added water h w = 0.2 Btu/lb dry air (from small diagram, 37 gr at 70°F) Then q a = h 2 ? h 1 + h w = 34.08 ? 33.88 + 0.2 = 0 Example 5: Cooling and Dehumidification Find the cooling load per pound of dry air resulting from infiltration of room air at 80°F dry-bulb tem- perature and 67°F wet-bulb temperature into a cooler maintained at 30°F dry- bulb and 28°F wet-bulb temperature, where moisture freezes on the coil, which is maintained at 20°F. Solution. The path followed on a psychrometric chart is shown in Fig. 12-9. Inlet enthalpy h 1 = h? 1 + D 1 = 31.62 ? 0.1 = 31.52 Btu/lb dry air Exit enthalpy h 2 = h? 2 + D 2 = 10.1 + 0.06 = 10.16 Btu/lb dry air Inlet moisture H 1 = 78 gr/lb dry air Exit moisture H 2 = 19 gr/lb dry air Moisture rejected ?H = 59 gr/lb dry air Enthalpy of rejected moisture =?1.26 Btu/lb dry air (from small  diagram of Fig. 12-2) Cooling load q r = 31.52 ? 10.16 + 1.26 = 22.62 Btu/lb dry air Note that if the enthalpy deviations were ignored, the calculated cooling load would be about 5 percent low. Example 6: Cooling Tower Determine water consumption and amount of heat dissipated per 1000 ft 3 /min of entering air at 90°F dry-bulb tem- perature and 70°F wet-bulb temperature when the air leaves saturated at 110°F and the makeup water is at 75°F. Solution. The path followed is shown in Fig. 12-10. PSYCHROMETRY 12-5 FIG. 12-2 Psychrometric chart—medium temperatures. Barometric pressure, 29.92 inHg.

Charged Particle Beams I-2 Preface ________    Charged Particle Beams is the product of a two-term course sequence that I taught on accelerator technology and beam physics at the University of New Mexico and at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The material for the two terms was divided into the dynamics of single charged particles and the description of large groups of particles (the collective behavior of beams). A previous book, Principles of Charged Particle Acceleration (available on the Internet at http://www.fieldp.com/cpa/cpa.html) covered single particle topics such as linear transfer matrices and the operation of accelerators. The new book is an introduction to charged- particle-beam physics.     In writing Charged Particle Beams my goal was to create a unified description that would be useful to a broad audience: accelerator designers, accelerator users, industrial engineers, and physics researchers. I organized the material to provide beginning students with the background to understand advanced literature and to use accelerators effectively. This book can serve as an independent reference. Combining Charged Particle Beams with Principles of Charged Particle Acceleration gives a programmed introduction to the field of particle acceleration. I began my research on particle beams with a background in plasma physics. This change in direction involved a difficult process of searching for material, learning from experts, and seeking past insights. Although I found excellent advanced references on specialized areas, no single work covered the topics necessary to understand high-power accelerators and high-brightness beams. The difficulties I faced encouraged me to write Charged Particle Beams. The book describes the basic ideas behind modern beam applications such as stochastic cooling, high-brightness injectors and the free-electron laser. Charged Particle Beams I-3    I was fortunate to have abundant help creating this book. Richard Cooper of Los Alamos National Laboratory applied his proofreading ability to the entire manuscript. In additional to mechanical corrections, his suggestions on technical points and emphasis were invaluable. The creation of this book was supported in part by a sabbatical leave from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of New Mexico. David Woodall. former Chairman of the Department of Chemical and Nuclear Engineering at the University of New Mexico, suggested the idea of the accelerator course sequence. I am grateful for his support during the development of the courses.    Several people contributed advice on specific sections of the book. Commentators included Kevin O'Brien of Sandia National Laboratories, John Creedon of Physics International Company, Brendan Godfrey of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory, Edward Lee of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, William Herrmannsfeldt of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and Carl Ekdahl of Los Alamos National Laboratory. I would also like to thank A. V. Tollestrup of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory for permission to paraphrase his article (coauthored by G. Dugan) on Elementary Stochastic Cooling.    I want to express appreciation to the students in my beam physics course at the University of New Mexico and at the Los Alamos Graduate Center. Through their contributions, I clarified and expanded the material over several years. Los Alamos National Laboratory supported the courses since their inception. I want to thank Robert Jameson and Alan Wadlinger of the Accelerator Technology Division for their encouragement. The efforts of the Instructional Television Center of UNM made it feasible to present classes at Los Alamos. I have also taught the material in short course format. I am grateful to Thomas Roberts and Stanley Pruett for organizing a course at the Strategic Defense Command.    Several accelerator science groups helped in the development of material for the book. I have worked closely with the Heavy Ion Fusion Accelerator Research Group at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for several years. I want to thank Henry Rutkowski, Thomas Fessenden, Denis Keefe and Edward Lee for their suggestions on the book and for providing the opportunity to work in the field of accelerator inertial fusion. The long-term support of Charles Roberson of the Office of Naval Research has been critical for accelerator research at the University of New Mexico. The University has also received generous research support from Groups CLS-7 and P-14 of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. I am grateful to Roger Bangerter and the late Kenneth Riepe who initiated the UNM program on vacuum arc plasma sources. I would also like to thank Carl Ekdahl – much of the material in this book evolved from spirited discussions on high-current beam physics. Charged Particle Beams I-4    During the composition of this book, I had the opportunity to participate in several research programs on high-power accelerators. I would like to thank Ralph Genuario and George Fraser of Physics International Company, Sidney Putnam of Pulse Sciences Incorporated, Robert Meger of the Naval Research Laboratory, Martin Nahemow of the Westinghouse Research and Development Center, Richard Adler of North Star Research Corporation, Daniel Sloan of CH2M-Hill, Kenneth Moses of Jaycor, and R. Bruce Miller of Titan Technologies. I would like to acknowledge two meetings that I attended during the creation of the book. The first is the NATO Workshop on High Brightness Beams in Pitlochry, Scotland. I express my appreciation to Anthony Hyder for organizing this workshop. I have particularly enjoyed participating in the U.S. Particle Accelerator Schools organized by Melvin Month. Finally, I would to thank John Wiley and Sons Incorporated for graciously reverting the copyright on this book so I could prepare this Internet version. STANLEY HUMPHRIES, JR.

Fisica Words to the reader about how to use this textbook I. What This Book Does and Does Not Contain This text is intended for use by beginning graduate students and advanced upper division undergraduate students in all areas of chemistry. It provides: (i) An introduction to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics as they apply to chemistry, (ii) Material that provides brief introductions to the subjects of molecular spectroscopy and chemical dynamics, (iii) An introduction to computational chemistry applied to the treatment of electronic structures of atoms, molecules, radicals, and ions, (iv) A large number of exercises, problems, and detailed solutions. It does not provide much historical perspective on the development of quantum mechanics. Subjects such as the photoelectric effect, black-body radiation, the dual nature of electrons and photons, and the Davisson and Germer experiments are not even discussed. To provide a text that students can use to gain introductory level knowledge of quantum mechanics as applied to chemistry problems, such a non-historical approach had to be followed. This text immediately exposes the reader to the machinery of quantum mechanics. Sections 1 and 2 (i.e., Chapters 1-7), together with Appendices A, B, C and E, could constitute a one-semester course for most first-year Ph. D. programs in the U. S. A. Section 3 (Chapters 8-12) and selected material from other appendices or selections from Section 6 would be appropriate for a second-quarter or second-semester course. Chapters 13- 15 of Sections 4 and 5 would be of use for providing a link to a one-quarter or one- semester class covering molecular spectroscopy. Chapter 16 of Section 5 provides a brief introduction to chemical dynamics that could be used at the beginning of a class on this subject. There are many quantum chemistry and quantum mechanics textbooks that cover material similar to that contained in Sections 1 and 2; in fact, our treatment of this material is generally briefer and less detailed than one finds in, for example,     Quantum Chemistry    , H. Eyring, J. Walter, and G. E. Kimball, J. Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y. (1947),     Quantum Chemistry    , D. A. McQuarrie, University Science Books, Mill Valley, Ca. (1983),       Molecular Quantum Mechanics   , P. W. Atkins, Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, England (1983), or     Quantum Chemistry    , I. N. Levine, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N. J. (1991), Depending on the backgrounds of the students, our coverage may have to be supplemented in these first two Sections. By covering this introductory material in less detail, we are able, within the confines of a text that can be used for a one-year or a two-quarter course, to introduce the student to the more modern subjects treated in Sections 3, 5, and 6. Our coverage of modern quantum chemistry methodology is not as detailed as that found in      Modern     Quantum Chemistry    , A. Szabo and N. S. Ostlund, Mc Graw-Hill, New York (1989), which contains little or none of the introductory material of our Sections 1 and 2. By combining both introductory and modern up-to-date quantum chemistry material in a single book designed to serve as a text for one-quarter, one-semester, two-quarter, or one-year classes for first-year graduate students, we offer a unique product. It is anticipated that a course dealing with atomic and molecular spectroscopy will follow the student's mastery of the material covered in Sections 1- 4. For this reason, beyond these introductory sections, this text's emphasis is placed on electronic structure applications rather than on vibrational and rotational energy levels, which are traditionally covered in considerable detail in spectroscopy courses. In brief summary, this book includes the following material: 1. The Section entitled The Basic Tools of Quantum Mechanics treats the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics and several applications to exactly soluble model problems. These problems include the conventional particle-in-a-box (in one and more dimensions), rigid-rotor, harmonic oscillator, and one-electron hydrogenic atomic orbitals. The concept of the Born-Oppenheimer separation of electronic and vibration-rotation motions is introduced here. Moreover, the vibrational and rotational energies, states, and wavefunctions of diatomic, linear polyatomic and non-linear polyatomic molecules are discussed here at an introductory level. This section also introduces the variational method and perturbation theory as tools that are used to deal with problems that can not be solved exactly. 2. The Section Simple Molecular Orbital Theory deals with atomic and molecular orbitals in a qualitative manner, including their symmetries, shapes, sizes, and energies. It introduces bonding, non-bonding, and antibonding orbitals, delocalized, hybrid, and Rydberg orbitals, and introduces Hückel-level models for the calculation of molecular orbitals as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (a more extensive treatment of several semi-empirical methods is provided in Appendix F). This section also develops the Orbital Correlation Diagram concept that plays a central role in using Woodward- Hoffmann rules to predict whether chemical reactions encounter symmetry-imposed barriers. 3. The Electronic Configurations, Term Symbols, and States Section treats the spatial, angular momentum, and spin symmetries of the many-electron wavefunctions that are formed as antisymmetrized products of atomic or molecular orbitals. Proper coupling of angular momenta (orbital and spin) is covered here, and atomic and molecular term symbols are treated. The need to include Configuration Interaction to achieve qualitatively correct descriptions of certain species' electronic structures is treated here. The role of the resultant Configuration Correlation Diagrams in the Woodward- Hoffmann theory of chemical reactivity is also developed. 4. The Section on Molecular Rotation and Vibration provides an introduction to how vibrational and rotational energy levels and wavefunctions are expressed for diatomic, linear polyatomic, and non-linear polyatomic molecules whose electronic energies are described by a single potential energy surface. Rotations of "rigid" molecules and harmonic vibrations of uncoupled normal modes constitute the starting point of such treatments. 5. The Time Dependent Processes Section uses time-dependent perturbation theory, combined with the classical electric and magnetic fields that arise due to the interaction of photons with the nuclei and electrons of a molecule, to derive expressions for the rates of transitions among atomic or molecular electronic, vibrational, and rotational states induced by photon absorption or emission. Sources of line broadening and time correlation function treatments of absorption lineshapes are briefly introduced. Finally, transitions induced by collisions rather than by electromagnetic fields are briefly treated to provide an introduction to the subject of theoretical chemical dynamics. 6. The Section on More Quantitive Aspects of Electronic Structure Calculations introduces many of the computational chemistry methods that are used to quantitatively evaluate molecular orbital and configuration mixing amplitudes. The Hartree-Fock self-consistent field (SCF), configuration interaction (CI), multiconfigurational SCF (MCSCF), many-body and Møller-Plesset perturbation theories, coupled-cluster (CC), and density functional or X?-like methods are included. The strengths and weaknesses of each of these techniques are discussed in some detail. Having mastered this section, the reader should be familiar with how potential energy hypersurfaces, molecular properties, forces on the individual atomic centers, and responses to externally applied fields or perturbations are evaluated on high speed computers. II. How to Use This Book: Other Sources of Information and Building Necessary Background In most class room settings, the group of students learning quantum mechanics as it applies to chemistry have quite diverse backgrounds. In particular, the level of preparation in mathematics is likely to vary considerably from student to student, as will the exposure to symmetry and group theory. This text is organized in a manner that allows students to skip material that is already familiar while providing access to most if not all necessary background material. This is accomplished by dividing the material into sections, chapters and Appendices which fill in the background, provide methodological tools, and provide additional details. The Appendices covering Point Group Symmetry and Mathematics Review are especially important to master. Neither of these two Appendices provides a first-principles treatment of their subject matter. The students are assumed to have fulfilled normal American Chemical Society mathematics requirements for a degree in chemistry, so only a review of the material especially relevant to quantum chemistry is given in the Mathematics Review Appendix. Likewise, the student is assumed to have learned or to be simultaneously learning about symmetry and group theory as applied to chemistry, so this subject is treated in a review and practical-application manner here. If group theory is to be included as an integral part of the class, then this text should be supplemented (e.g., by using the text     Chemical Applications of Group Theory    , F. A. Cotton, Interscience, New York, N. Y. (1963)). The progression of sections leads the reader from the principles of quantum mechanics and several model problems which illustrate these principles and relate to chemical phenomena, through atomic and molecular orbitals, N-electron configurations, states, and term symbols, vibrational and rotational energy levels, photon-induced transitions among various levels, and eventually to computational techniques for treating chemical bonding and reactivity. At the end of each Section, a set of Review Exercises  and fully worked out answers are given. Attempting to work these exercises should allow the student to determine whether he or she needs to pursue additional background building via the Appendices . In addition to the Review Exercises , sets of Exercises and Problems, and their solutions, are given at the end of each section. The exercises are brief and highly focused on learning a particular skill. They allow the student to practice the mathematical steps and other material introduced in the section. The problems are more extensive and require that numerous steps be executed. They illustrate application of the material contained in the chapter to chemical phenomena and they help teach the relevance of this material to experimental chemistry. In many cases, new material is introduced in the problems, so all readers are encouraged to become actively involved in solving all problems. To further assist the learning process, readers may find it useful to consult other textbooks or literature references. Several particular texts are recommended for additional reading, further details, or simply an alternative point of view. They include the following (in each case, the abbreviated name used in this text is given following the proper reference): 1.     Quantum Chemistry    , H. Eyring, J. Walter, and G. E. Kimball, J.

Theory of relativity is a physical discipline which arose in the beginning of XX-th century. It has dramatically changed traditional notion about the structure of the Universe. Effects predicted by this theory becomes essential only when we describe processes at high velocities close to light velocity c = 2.998·105km/sec. In XIX-th century there was the only theory dealing with such processes, this was theory of electromagnetism. Development of theory of electromagnetism in XIX-th century became a premise for arising theory of relativity. In this book I follow historical sequence of events. In Chapter I electrostatics and magnetostatics are explained starting with first experiments on interaction of charges and currents. Chapter II is devoted to classical electrodynamics based on Maxwell equations. In the beginning of Chapter III Lorentz transformations are derived as transformations keeping form of Maxwell equations. Physical interpretation of such transformation requires uniting space and time into one four-dimensional continuum (Minkowsky space) where there is no fixed direction for time axis. Upon introducing four-dimensional space-time in Chapter III classical electrodynamics is rederived in the form invariant with respect to Lorentz transformations. In Chapter IV variational approach to describing electromag- netic field and other material fields in special relativity is con- sidered. Use of curvilinear coordinates in Minkowsky space and appropriate differential-geometric methods prepares background for passing to general relativity.

DUVIRYAK Institute for Condensed Matter Physics, 1 SvientsitskyjStreet, 290011, Lviv, Ukraine E-mail: duviryak@omega.icmp.lviv.ua Classical description of relativistic pointlike particle with intrinsic degrees of freedom such as isospin or colour is proposed. It is based on the Lagrangian of general form de?ned on thetangentbundleoveraprincipal?brebundle.

Twoofthem[2,3]knowntotheauthor are based on geometric notions brought from gauge ?eld theories. Namely, the con?guration space of particle is a principal ?bre bundle with the structure group being the gauge group; theinteractionofparticlewithanexternalgauge?eldisintroducedviatheconnectiononthis bundle. Theonlydi?erencebetweentwoapproachesconsistsinthechoiceofLagrangianfunc- tion. That proposed in [2] is linear in gauge potentials (as in classical electrodynamics) while thenonlinearLagrangian[3,2]arisesnaturallywithintheKaluza–Kleintheory. Nevertheless, bothofthemleadtothesameWongequations. Inthepresentpaper,startingfromthementionedabovegeometricaltreatmentofthekine- matics of relativistic particle with isospin or colour (Section 2), we construct in Section 3 the Lagrangian of a fairy general form. In particular cases this Lagrangian reduces to those of Refs.[2,3]. Thegeneralizationisnottrivialsinceitleadstotwotypesofdynamics,according to what variables are used for the description of intrinsic degrees of freedom. The external dynamicsisdescribedbytheWongequationswhichincludegaugepotentials, buttheformof whichisindi?erenttothechoiceofLagrangian.

A  Workshop  presented at the Society for Chaos Theory  in Psycholog y and the Life Sciences meeting, July 31,1997  at Marquette University, Miwaukee, Wisconsin. © Keith  Clayton     Table of Contents   • Introduction to Dynamic Systems    • Nonlinear Dynamic Systems    • Bifurcation Diagram    • Sensitivity to Initial Conditions    • Symptoms of Chaos    • Two -  and Three - dimensional Dynamic Systems    • Fractals and the Fractal Dimension    • Nonlinear Statistical Tools    • Glossary    Introduction to Dynamic Systems   What is a dynamic system?   A dynamic system is a set of functions  (rules, equation s) that  specify how variables change over time.   First example  ...   Alice's height diminishes by half every minute...   Second example  ...   x new  = x old  +  y old   y new =  x old   The second example illustrates a system with two variables,   x  and y . Variable x  is changed  by taking its old value and  adding the current value of y . And y  is changed by becoming  x 's old value. Silly system? Perhaps. We're just showing that  a dynamic system is any well - specified set of rules.   Here are some important  Distinctions:   • variables  (di mensions) vs. parameters   • discrete  vs. continuous  variables   • stochastic  vs. deterministic  dynamic systems     How they differ:   • Variables  change in time, parameters  do not.   • Discrete  variables are restricted to integer values,  continuous  variable are not.   • Stochas tic  systems are one - to - many; deterministic   systems are one - to - one     This last distinction will be made clearer as we go  along ...   Terms   The current state  of a dynamic system is specified by the  current value of its variables, x, y, z, ...   The process of ca lculating the new state of a discrete  system  is called iteration .     To evaluate how a system behaves, we need the functions,  parameter values and initial conditions  or starting state.   To illustrate ...Consider a classic learning theory, the alpha  model , whic h specifies how q n , the probability of making an  error on trial n, changed from one trial to the next   q n+1  = ß q n  The new error probability is diminished by ß  (which is less than 1, greater than 0). For example, let the the  probability of an error on trial  1 equal to 1, and ß equal .9.  Now we can calculate the dynamics by iterating the function,  and plot the  results.      q 1  = 1    q 2  = ßq 1  =  (.9)(1) = .9    q 3  = (.9)q 2  =  (.9)(.9) = .81    etc. ...     Error probabilities for the alpha model, assuming q 1 =1, ß  =.9.  Th is "learning curve" is referred to as a time series .   So far, we have some new ideas, but much is old ...   What's not  new   Dynamic Systems   Certainly the idea that systems change in time is not new.  Nor is the idea that the changes are probabilistic.   What's  new   Deterministic nonlinear  dynamic systems.   As we will see, these systems give us:   • A new meaning to the term unpredictable .   • A different attitude toward the concept of variability .   • Some new tools  for exploring time series data and for  modeling such beha vior.   • And, some argue, a new paradigm .   This last point is not pursued here.     Nonlinear Dynamic Systems     Nonlinear functions   What's a linear function?   Well, gee Mikey, it's one that can be written in the form of a  straight line. Remember the formula ...   y = mx + b   where m is the slope and b is the y - intercept?   What's a nonlinear function?   What makes a dynamic system nonlinear ....   is whether the function specifying the change is nonlinear.  Not whether its behavior is nonlinear.   And y is a nonlinear funct ion of x if  x is multiplied by  another (non - constant) variable, or multiplied by itself (i. e.,  raised to some power).   We illustrate nonlinear  systems using ...      Logistic Difference Equation   ... a model often used to introduce chaos. The Logistic  Differe nce Equation, or Logistic Map , though simple,  displays the major chaotic concepts.   Growth model   We start, generally, with a model of growth.   x new  = r x old   We prefer to write this in terms of n:     x n+1  = r  x n .   This says x changes from one time period, n, t o the next,  n+1, according to r.  If r is larger than one , x gets larger with  successive iterations If r is less than one , x diminishes. (In  the "Alice" example at the beginning, r is .5).   Let's set r to be larger than one...         We start, year 1 (n=1),  w ith a population of 16  [x 1 =16], and since  r=1.5, each year x is  increased by 50%. So  years 2, 3, 4, 5, ... have  magnitudes 24, 36, 54,  ...   Our population is  growing exponentially.  By year 25 we have  over a quarter million.     Iterations of Growth model with r = 1.5    So far, notice, we have a linear  model that produces  unlimited growth.   Limited Growth model -  Logistic Map.   The Logistic Map prevents unlimited growth by inhibiting  growth whenever it achieves a high level. This is achieved  with an additional te rm, [1 -  x n ].   The growth measure (x) is also rescaled so that the maximum  value x can achieve is transformed to 1. (So if the maximum  size is 25 million, say, x is expressed as a proportion of that  maximum.)   Our new model is   x n+1  = r x n  [1 -  x n ]   [r betwee n 0 and 4.]   The  [1 - x n ] term serves to inhibit growth because as x   approaches 1 , [1 - x n ]   approaches 0 .        
Fisica arXiv:quant-ph/9901025 v1   12 Jan 1999 How to share a quantum secret Richard Cleve1 , Daniel Gottesman2y, Hoi-Kwong Lo3z 1 Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 1N4 2 T-6 Group, Los Alamos National Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 3 Hewlett-Packard Labs, Bristol, UK BS34 8QZ We investigate the concept of quantum secret sharing. In a ((k;n)) threshold scheme, a secret quantum state is di- vided into n shares such that any k of those shares can be used to reconstruct the secret, but any set of k 1 or fewer shares contains absolutely no information about the secret. We show that the only constraint on the existence of thresh- old schemes comes from the quantum \no-cloning theorem", which requires that n< 2k, and, in all such cases, we give an e cient construction of a ((k;n)) threshold scheme. We also explore similarities and di erences between quantum secret sharing schemes and quantum error-correcting codes. One remarkable di erence is that, while most existing quantum codes encode pure states as pure states, quantum secret shar- ing schemes must use mixed states in some cases. For exam- ple, if k n< 2k 1 then any ((k;n)) threshold scheme must distribute information that is globally in a mixed state. Suppose that the president of a bank wants to give access to a vault to three vice presidents who are not en- tirely trusted. Instead of giving the combination to any one individual, it may be desirable to distribute informa- tion in such a way that no vice president alone has any knowledge of the combination, but any two of them can jointly determine the combination. In 1979, Blakely [1] and Shamir [2] addressed a generalization of this prob- lem, by showing how to construct schemes that divide a secret into n shares such that any k of those shares can be used to reconstruct the secret, but any set of k 1 or fewer shares contains absolutely no information about the secret. This is called a (k;n) threshold scheme, and is a useful tool for designing cryptographic key manage- ment systems. Now, consider a generalization of such schemes to the setting of quantum information, where the secret is an ar- bitrary unknown quantum state. Salvail [3] (see also [4]) obtained a method to divide an unknown qubit into two shares, each of which individually contains no informa- tion about the qubit, but which jointly can be used to reconstruct the qubit. Hillery, Bu zek, and Berthi- aume [4] proposed a method for implementing some clas-  Email: cleve@cpsc.ucalgary.ca yEmail: gottesma@t6-serv.lanl.gov zEmail: hkl@hplb.hpl.hp.com sical threshold schemes that uses quantum information to transmit the shares securely in the presence of eaves- droppers. De ne a ((k;n)) threshold scheme, with k  n, as a method to encode and divide an arbitrary secret quan- tum state (which is given but not, in general, explicitly known) into n shares with the following two properties. First, from any k or more shares the secret quantum state can be perfectly reconstructed. Second, from any k 1 or fewer shares, no information at all can be deduced about the secret quantum state. Formally, this means that the reduced density matrix of these k 1 shares (with the other shares traced out) is independent of the value of the secret. Each share can consist of any num- ber of qubits (or higher-dimensional states), and not all shares need to be of the same size. In this paper we do not consider the problem of securely creating and dis- tributing the shared secret, and simply assume that it can be done when necessary. Quantum secret sharing schemes might be used in the context of sharing quantum keys, such as those proposed by Weisner [5] for uncounterfeitable \quantum money." They can also be used to provide interesting ways of dis- tributing quantum entanglement and nonlocality. For ex- ample, suppose that Alice has one qubit of an EPR pair and a ((2;2)) threshold scheme is applied to the other qubit to produce a share for Bob and a share for Carol. Then Alice and Bob together have a product state (i.e.,  AB =  A  B), as do Alice and Carol; however, Bob and Carol can jointly construct a qubit from their shares that is in an EPR state with Alice’s qubit. Also, for quantum storage or quantum computations to be robust in the worst-case situation where a component or a group of components fail (due to sabotage by malicious parties or due to defects), quantum secret sharing may prove to be a useful concept. Finally, by de nition, quantum secret sharing distributes trust between various parties and prevents a small coalition of malicious parties from learning a quantum secret. Let us begin with an example of a ((2;3)) threshold scheme. The secret here is an arbitrary three-dimensional quantum state (a quantum trit or qutrit). The encoding maps the secret qutrit to three qutrits as  j0i+ j1i+  j2i7! (j000i+j111i+j222i) + (1)  (j012i+j120i+j201i) +  (j021i+j102i+j210i); 1 and each resulting qutrit is taken as a share. Note that, from a single share, absolutely no information can be deduced about the secret, since each individual share is always in the totally mixed state (an equal mixture of j0i, j1i, and j2i). On the other hand, the secret can be reconstructed from any two of the three shares as follows. If we are given the  rst two shares (for instance), add the value of the  rst share to the second (modulo three), and then add the value of the second share to the  rst, to obtain the state ( j0i+  j1i+ j2i)(j00i+j12i+j21i): (2) The  rst qutrit now contains the secret. The reconstruc- tion procedure for the other cases is similar, by the sym- metry of mapping (1) with respect to cyclic permutations of the three qutrits. Note that, because the data is quantum, one must be careful not to individually measure the shares while per- forming the reconstruction, since this will collapse any superposition of the basis states. The same considera- tions arise with quantum error-correcting codes [6,7]. In fact, the above example is a three-qutrit quantum code that can correct one erasure error. Every quantum se- cret sharing scheme is, in some sense, a quantum error- correcting code; however, some error-correcting codes are not secret sharing schemes, since they may contain sets of shares from which partial information about the secret can be obtained. For example, consider a four-qubit code [8,9] that corrects one erasure by the encoding  j0i+  j1i7 ! (j0000i+j1111i) + (j0011i+j1100i) (the code can actually be extended to encode two qubits, but we do not need this for our illustration). While it is true that any three qubits su ce to reconstruct the secret, it is not true that two qubits provide no informa- tion. For instance, given the  rst and third qubits, one can distinguish between the secrets j0i and j1i. More generally, from these two qubits, statistical information about the relative values of j jand j j can be obtained. Later, we shall show how to obtain a ((3;4)) threshold scheme with four qubits using a di erent approach. Returning to the ((2;3)) threshold scheme using qutrits, note that it can be used to share a secret that is a qubit by simply not using the third dimension of the input space (though the resulting shares are still full qutrits). It turns out that there does not exist a ((2;3)) threshold scheme for qubits in which each share is also a qubit. This is because such a scheme would also be a three-qubit code that corrects single qubit erasure errors, which has been shown not to exist [9]. The ((2;3)) qutrit threshold scheme can be used to construct a ((2;2)) threshold scheme, by simply discard- ing (i.e., tracing out) one of the three shares. Note that the resulting ((2;2)) scheme produces a mixed state en- coding even when the secret is a pure state. The encoding procedure can be de ned by the following linear map on density matrices j0ih0j7!j00ih00j+j11ih11j+j22ih22j j1ih1j7!j01ih01j+j12ih12j+j20ih20j (3) j2ih2j7!j02ih02j+j10ih10j+j21ih21j: Call a scheme that encodes pure state secrets using global pure states a pure state scheme, and a scheme for which the encodings of pure states are sometimes in global mixed states a mixed state scheme. We shall show later that there does not exist a pure state ((2;2)) threshold scheme. On the other hand, if we do not insist on protecting an arbitrary secret, we could use the encoding  j0i+  j1i7! (j00i j11i) + (j01i+j10i): (4) For the restricted set of secrets where     is real- valued, it functions as a ((2;2)) threshold scheme. How- ever, without this restriction, this is not a secret sharing scheme, since (for example) it can be veri ed that a sin- gle share can completely distinguish between the secrets j0i+ ij1i and j0i ij1i. Although such a scheme may be useful in some contexts, we shall henceforth consider only \unrestricted" secret sharing schemes. Note that the previously mentioned technique of dis- carding a share from a ((2;3)) threshold scheme to obtain a ((2;2)) threshold scheme (suggested by [10] in the con- text of a di erent scheme) generalizes considerably: Theorem 1. From any ((k;n)) threshold scheme with n>k, a ((k;n 1)) threshold scheme can be constructed by discarding one share. In the classical case, a (k;n) threshold scheme exists for every value of n k. However, this does not hold in the quantum case, due to the quantum \no-cloning theo- rem" [11,12], which states that no operation can produce multiple copies of an unknown arbitrary quantum state. Theorem 2. If n 2k then no ((k;n)) threshold scheme exists. Proof. If a ((k;n)) threshold scheme exists with n 2k then the following procedure can be used to make two independent copies of an arbitrary quantum state (that is, to clone). First, apply the ((k;n)) scheme to the state to produce n shares. Then, taking two disjoint sets of k shares, reconstruct two independent copies of the state. This contradicts the \no-cloning theorem" [11,12]. a0 The  ve-qubit quantum code proposed in [13,14] im- mediately yields a ((3;5)) threshold scheme. First, since it corrects any two erasure errors, it enables the secret to be reconstructed from any three shares. Also, any pair of qubits provides no information about the data. This is a consequence of the following more general theorem. Theorem 3. If a quantum code with codewords of length 2k 1 corrects k 1 erasure errors (which, for sta- bilizer codes [15,16], is a [[2k 1;1;k]]q code, where q is 2 the dimensionality of each coordinate and of the encoded state) then it is also a ((k;2k 1)) threshold scheme. Proof. First, suppose that we are given a set of k shares. Since this set excludes precisely k 1 shares and the code corrects any k 1 erasures, the secret can be re- constructed from these k shares. On the other hand, suppose that we are given a set of k 1 shares. This subset excludes a set of k shares, from which we know that the secret can be perfectly reconstructed. Now, in quantum mechanics, it is well-known that any informa- tion gain on an unknown quantum state necessarily leads to its disturbance [17]. Therefore, if a measurement on the given k 1 shares provided any information about the secret, then this measurement would disturb the in- formation that the remaining k qubits contain about the secret. This leads to a contradiction. a0 Combining Theorem 3 with Theorem 1, we obtain Corollary 4. From a [[2k 1;1;k]]q code, a ((k;n)) threshold scheme can be constructed for any n< 2k. For example, from the aforementioned  ve-qubit code, a ((3;4)) threshold scheme and ((3;3)) threshold scheme can be obtained (by discarding shares). Next, we prove the converse of Theorem 2. Theorem 5. If n< 2k, then a ((k;n)) threshold scheme exists. Moreover, the dimension of each share can be bounded above by 2 max(2k 1;s), where s is the di- mension of the quantum secret. Proof. The proof is based on a class of quantum poly- nomial codes, which are similar to those de ned by Aharonov and Ben-Or [18], who used them in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computation. We will show how to construct such a code of length m and degree k 1 whenever m< 2k, and that the data that it encodes can always be recovered from any k of its m coordinates. Then, considering the special case where m = 2k 1, we obtain a [[2k 1;1;k]]q code, for which Corollary 4 applies to prove the theorem. Let k and m be given with m < 2k, and let s be the dimension of the quantum state to be encoded. Choose a prime q such that max(m;s)  q  2 max(m;s) (which is always possible [19]) and let F = Zq. For c = (c0;c1;:::;ck 1)2Fk, de ne the polynomialpc(t) = c0 +c1t+   +ck 1tk 1. Let x0;:::;xm 1 be m distinct elements of F. Encode a q-ary quantum state by the linear mapping which is de ned on basis states jsi (for s2F) as jsi7! X c2Fk ck 1=s jpc(x0);:::;pc(xm 1)i: (5) As an example, it turns out that mapping (1) (for the ((2;3)) threshold scheme given at the beginning of this paper) is a quantum polynomial code with k = 2, m = 3, and q = 3. It now su ces to show that, given an encoding (5) of a quantum state, the state can be recovered from any k of the m coordinates. One way to show this is to apply the theory of CSS codes [20,21], noting that this code is formed from the two classical codes C1 =  (pc(x0);:::;pc(xm 1))jc2Fk (6) C2 =  (pc(x0);:::;pc(xm 1))jc2Fk;ck 1 = 0 (7) and that min(dist C1;dist C?2 ) = m k + 1. From this it follows that the code corrects m k erasure errors. For completeness, we also give an explicit decoding procedure for the case of interest, where m = 2k 1. We begin with some preliminary de nitions. For an invert- ible d d matrix M, de ne the operation apply M to a sequence of d quantum registers as applying the mapping j(y0;:::;yd 1)i7!j(y0;:::;yd 1)Mi (8) (where we are equating j(y0;:::;yd 1)i with jy0;:::;yd 1i). For z0;:::;zd 1 2 F, de ne the d d Vandermonde matrix [Vd(z0;:::;zd 1)]ij = zij (9) (for i;j2f0;:::;d 1g). This matrix is invertible when- ever z0;:::;zd 1 are distinct. Also, note that applying Vd(z0;:::;zd 1) to registers in state jc0;:::;cd 1i yields the state jpc(z0);:::;pc(zd 1)i, where c = (c0;:::;cd 1). The secret can be recovered from any k coordinates by the following procedure. Call the m registers containing the coordinates R0;:::;Rm 1, and suppose that we are given, say, the  rst k registers (that is, R0;:::;Rk 1). 1. Apply Vk(x0;:::;xk 1) 1 to R0;:::;Rk 1. 2. Cyclically shift the  rst k registers by one to the right by setting (R0;R1:::;Rk 1) to (Rk 1;R0;:::;Rk 2). 3. Apply Vk 1(xk;:::;xm 1) to R1;:::;Rk 1. 4. For all i2f1;:::;k 1g, add R0 (xk+i 1)k 1 to Ri. Consider an execution of the above procedure on a state resulting from the encoding (5) on a basis state jsi. After steps 1 and 2, the state of the n registers is X c2Fk ck 1=s jck 1;c0;:::;ck 2ijpc(xk);:::;pc(xm 1)i =jsi X c2Fk ck 1=s jc0;:::;ck 2ijpc(xk);:::;pc(xm 1)i: (10) If the data is a basis state jsi (for some s 2 F) then, at this point, its recovery is complete. However, for a general secret, which is a superposition ofjsistates, reg- ister R0 is entangled with the other registers. The en- tanglement is due to the fact that, in (10), the value 3 of s can be determined by the value of any of the kets jc0;:::;ck 2ijpc(xk);:::;pc(xm 1)i. In fact, if we had m 2k then s could be determined from just the state of the last m k registers, so it would be impossible to perform the necessary disentanglement by accessing only the  rst k registers. Since m = 2k 1, this is not a prob- lem and the remaining steps correctly extract the data in the following manner. After steps 3 and 4, the state is jsi X c2Fk ck 1=s jpc(xk);:::;pc(xm 1)ijpc(xk);:::;pc(xm 1)i =jsi X y2Fk 1 jy1;:::;yk 1ijy1;:::;yk 1i; (11) where the last equality holds since, for any s 2 F and y1;:::;yk 12F, there is a unique c2Fk with ck 1 = s such that pc(xk+i 1) = yi, for alli2f1;:::;k 1g. Since the state of R1;:::;Rm 1 is now independent of s, the decoding procedure is now correct for arbitrary data. a0 Although we have focused on threshold schemes, it is possible to consider more general access structures. In a general quantum secret sharing scheme, from cer- tain authorized sets of shares, the secret can be recon- structed, while, from all other sets of shares, no infor- mation can be obtained about the secret. Those other sets are called unauthorized sets. For example, consider a scenario with three shares, A, B, C, where the autho- rized sets arefA;Bg,fA;Cg, and any superset of one of these sets. Such a secret sharing scheme can be easily im- plemented by starting with the ((3;4)) threshold scheme and bundling the  rst two shares into the share A. We have already seen relationships between quan- tum secret sharing schemes and quantum error-correcting codes. We now explore this connection more deeply. The following proposition follows naturally from the usual formulation of the conditions for a quantum error- correcting code. Proposition 6. Let C be a subspace of a Hilbert space H. The following conditions are equivalent: a) C corrects erasures on a set K of coordinates. b) For any orthonormal basis fj iig ofC, h ijEj ji= 0 (i6= j) (12) h ijEj ii= c(E) (13) for all operators E acting on K. c) For all (normalized)j i2C and all E acting on K, h jEj i= c(E): (14) Note that the same functionc(E) appears in conditions (b) and (c), and that it is independent ofj i orj ii. Proof. a),b) is essentially the standard quantum error correction conditions [13,23] applied to erasure errors [9]. b) , c) is straightforward. Alternately, a) , c) follows from the main theorem of [22]. a0 Equation (12) says that in correcting errors, we will never confuse two di erent basis vectors. Equation (13) says that learning about the error will never give us any information about which basis vector we have. This is im- portant, since that information would constitute a mea- surement, collapsing a superposition of basis vectors. On the other hand, condition (14) simply says that the environment can never gain any information about the state. In other words, the proposition tells us that protecting a state from noise is exactly the same as pre- venting the environment from learning about it. Condition (14) is also very convenient for our purposes, since the two constraints that arise on a quantum secret sharing scheme are the ability to correct erasures and the requirement that no information be gained by unautho- rized sets of shares. In the theory of quantum error-correcting codes, we usually consider shares of the same dimension. In con- trast, in quantum secret sharing, we would like to allow shares to live in Hilbert spaces of di erent sizes. Never- theless, it is still true that conditions a), b), and c) in Proposition 6 are equivalent. Theorem 7. An encoding f :j i7!j i is a pure state quantum secret sharing scheme i  h jEj i= c(E) (15) (independent of j i) whenever E is an operator acting on the complement of an authorized set or when E is an operator acting on an unauthorized set. For instance, for the three-qutrit scheme (1) and Ejjy1;y2;y3i = !yjjy1;y2;y3i, where ! = exp(2 i=3), we haveh jEjj i= 0 for all statesj iused in the scheme. Proof. Let C be the image of f. S is an authorized set i the subspace C can correct for erasures on K, the complement of S. By Proposition 6, this means S is an authorized set i (15) holds for all E acting on K. T is an unauthorized set whenever we can gain no information about the statej ifrom any measurement on T. That is, the expectation value h jEj i is independent of j i2C for any operator E we could choose to measure, which means it must act on T. Again, this is condition (15). a0 Theorem 7 has at least one remarkable consequence: Corollary 8. For a pure state quantum secret sharing scheme, every unauthorized set of shares is the comple- ment of an authorized set and vice-versa. Proof. If the complement of an authorized set of shares S1 were another authorized set S2 then we could create 4 two copies of the secret from S1 and S2, violating the no-cloning theorem. Therefore, the complement of an authorized set is always an unauthorized set. On the other hand, by Proposition 6, if condition (15) holds on an unauthorized set T, we can correct erasures on T, and therefore reconstruct the secret on the com- plement of T. Therefore, the complement of an unautho- rized set is always an authorized set. a0 For a pure state ((k;n)) threshold scheme, this condi- tion implies that n k = k 1. Therefore: Corollary 9. Any ((k;n)) pure state threshold scheme satis es n = 2k 1. Clearly, this corollary does not apply to mixed state schemes, since we have constructed ((k;n)) threshold schemes with n< 2k 1.

Importance of collision phenomena  Many experiments in physics, especially in high energy physics, consist of  directing a beam of particles (1) (produced for example, by an accelerator) onto  a target composed of particles (2), and studying the resulting collisions : the various  particles* constituting the final state of the system - that is, the state after the  collision (cf: fig. 1) - are detected and their characteristics (direction of emission,  energy, etc.) are measured. Obviously, the aim of such a study is to determine the  interactions that occur between the various particles entering into the collision.

The two detectors represented in the figure measure the number of particles  scattered through angles 0, and 0, with respect to the incident beam.  The phenomena observed are sometimes very complex. For example, if  particles (I) and (2) are in fact composed of more elementary components (protons  and neutrons in the case of nuclei), the latter can, during the collision, redistribute  themselves amongst two or several final composite particles which are different  from the initial particles; in this case, one speaks of "rearrangement collisions".  * In practice, it is not always possible to detect all the particles emitted, and one must often be  satisfied with partial information about the final system.

Cole and Yi Zou Department of Manufacturing Engineering, 15 St. Mary’s Street, Boston University, Brookline, Massachusetts 02446, USA H20849Received 9 May 2003H20850 Here we show that a wide range of states of phases and amplitudes exist for a circularly polarized H20849CPH20850 plane wave to act on a classical hydrogen model to achieve infinite times of stability H20849i.e., no orbital decay due to radiation reaction effectsH20850. An analytic solution is first deduced to show this effect for circular orbits in the nonrelativistic approximation. We then use this analytic result to help provide insight into detailed simulation investigations of deviations from these idealistic conditions. By changing the phase of the CP wave, the time t d when orbital decay sets in can be made to vary enormously. The patterns of this behavior are examined here and analyzed in physical terms for the underlying but rather unintuitive reasons for these nonlinear effects. We speculate that most of these effects can be generalized to analogous elliptical orbital conditions with a specific infinite set of CP waves present. The paper ends by briefly considering multiple CP plane waves acting on the classical hydrogen atom in an initial circular orbital state, resulting in ‘‘jumplike’’ and ‘‘diffusionlike’’ orbital motions for this highly nonlinear system. These simple examples reveal the possibility of very rich and complex patterns that occur when a wide spectrum of radiation acts on this classical hydrogen system.

INTRODUCTION The hydrogen atom has received renewed attention in the past decade or so, due to studies involved with Rydberg analysis, chaos, and scarring H208511–4H20852. Classical and semiclas- sical analysis have been found in the past to offer helpful insight and predictability on the behavior of Rydberg-like atoms. However, in these previous interesting works involv- ing classical and semiclassical analyses of ionization behav- ior and chaotic and scarred orbits of Rydberg systems H20849see, for example, Refs. H208512,3,5–8H20852, and cited references thereinH20850, the radiation reaction term in the Lorentz-Dirac equation H208519H20852 describing the behavior of classical charged point particles is rarely, if at all, considered. Although physicists certainly agree that this term is necessary in a consistent classical elec- trodynamic treatment of classical charged particles H208519–12H20852, still, this is the term that persuaded physicists in the early 1900s that a completely classical treatment of the atom was not a viable explanation for atomic behavior, as it would necessarily result in a collapse of the electron’s orbit in a time of about 1.3H1100310 H1100211 sec. This observation, and other apparently nonclassical effects H20849blackbody radiation, photo- electric effect, etc.H20850, spurred the development of Bohr’s atomic model, followed by the more complete work by Heisenberg, Schro ¨ dinger, Dirac, and others of quantum me- chanics. Nevertheless, our recent work H2085113–15H20852 has revealed a number of interesting situations as a result of the very non- linear behavior of the Coulombic binding potential, as well as the small but steady action of the radiation reaction damp- ing force, and the presence of applied electromagnetic radia- tion acting on the classical atom. Our intention is to continue this development, building upon previous work to include the effects of multiple plane waves. We expect at the very least to continue to uncover interesting and surprising results of the nonlinear behavior of this classical system. However, we also expect that the results may prove helpful in revealing better why the classical analysis can in some cases provide excellent insight into the behavior of Rydberg atomic sys- tems. For example, the literature is full of such observations, such as in the extensive paper of Ref. H208512H20852, p. 291: ‘‘Where the quantitative agreement between experimental data and classical calculations is good for threshold field amplitudes for the onset of ‘‘ionization,’’ the classical theory gives keen insight into the semiclassical dynamics. Conversely, where the quantitative agreement breaks down is a signature for the importance of quantal effects. Often this occurs where the nonclassical behavior is, nevertheless, still anchored in subtle ways to the classical dynamics in and near nonlinear reso- nances.’’ Pushing on such understanding should prove to be helpful in modeling, as simply as possible, the surprisingly complex behavior that has been reported for Rydberg-like systems. We are hopeful to be able to use such models in technology application situations. Finally, at the most, we are hopeful to uncover more of when, why, and possibly why not, the theory of stochastic electrodynamics H20849SEDH20850 holds for the simple classical hydro- gen atom. As reported in much more detail elsewhere H2085115– 18H20852, SED is an entirely classical theory of nature that con- siders the interaction of classical charged particles with electromagnetic fields, using Maxwell’s classical electro- magnetic equations, while also considering that an equilib- rium situation for particles and fields at temperature TH110050 necessarily requires the presence of classical electromagnetic zero-point H20849ZPH20850 radiation. This idea has revealed a number of surprisingly quantum mechanical-like properties to be pre- dicted from this entirely classical theory. However, when at- tacking realistic atomic systems in nature, rather than simple approximate systems as the simple harmonic oscillator, se- vere difficulties have been reported in the past H2085117,18H20852.We have been suspicious that some of these difficulties may sim- ply be due to the inherent difficulty of analyzing the subtle nonlinear effects of a Coulombic binding potential H2085119,20H20852; PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68, 0666XX H208492003H20850 1063-651X/2003/68H208496H20850/0666XXH2084912H20850/$20.00 ©2003 The American Physical Society68 0666XX-1   PROOF COPY [EE8970] 181312PRE     PROOF COPY [EE8970] 181312PRE     PROOF COPY [EE8970] 181312PRE   the present study, along with other work to be presented in the near future, is intended to help address some of these points. Indeed, our work in Ref. H2085121H20852 shows that a detailed simu- lation of the effects of classical electromagnetic radiation acting on a classical electron in a classical hydrogen poten- tial, results in a stochasticlike motion that yields a probabil- ity distribution over time that appears extremely close to the ground state probability distribution for hydrogen. Clearly there are tantalizing physical aspects yet to be understood here of the ramifications of this work. These particular simu- lations are extremely computationally intensive. However, for large orbits, as would typically occur in a Rydberg atom, the computations would become enormously smaller, thereby providing an efficient computational tool for addressing Ry- dberg atom behavior. Thus, in summary, we believe this re- search direction should provide an excellent technology re- lated simulation tool for studying much of Rydberg atom dynamics, while also providing the means for understanding much deeper ramifications of SED and its possible basis for much of quantum mechanics. Except for a preliminary result to be considered in the concluding section of this paper involving many plane waves, the present paper considers a single classical circu- larly polarized H20849CPH20850 plane wave interacting with the classical hydrogen atom. This atomic system will be treated here as consisting of a particle with charge H11002e and rest mass m, orbiting an infinitely massive and oppositely charged nucleus. In Ref. H2085115H20852 we carried out a perturbation analysis, showing in more detail why some of the nonlinear behaviors occur as first discussed in Ref. H2085113H20852. In particular, for the classical electron moving in a near circular orbit, with an applied CP plane wave normally directed at the plane of the orbit, then quasistability of the orbit can be achieved pro- vided the amplitude of the electric field of plane wave ex- ceeds a particular critical value. The result is a constant spi- ralling in and out motion of the electron, with the spirals growing larger and larger in amplitude, until finally a critical point is reached and then decay of the orbit occurs. As shown in Ref. H2085114H20852, this same behavior also occurs for more general, but more complicated, elliptical orbits, where now an infinite set of plane waves are required to achieve the same effect, where the plane waves are harmonics of the period of the orbit. In Sec. II of the present paper, we begin by providing more general conditions than considered in Ref. H2085113H20852 for achieving perfect stability for the interaction of a single CP wave with the classical hydrogen atom. This example will provide a clearer physical insight into why the effect of the phase of the CP plane wave, in relation to the motion of the orbiting electron, is so extremely important in changing the time to decay t d of the classical electron’s orbit. Section III then turns to a detailed simulation analysis of a wide range of conditions influencing t d . Many of these results seem physi- cally very unintuitive. Section IV then turns to explain and analyze some of these subtleties, by making use of some of the perturbation work in Ref. H2085115H20852. Finally, Sec. V ends with a few concluding remarks on where we anticipate this work is headed. Future papers are intended to report on work already finished or are in various stages of completion, including a full relativistic examina- tion, and the situation that is of great interest to us, is when a radiation spectrum is present that may possibly result in a thermodynamic equilibrium state with the classical atom. In anticipation of this work, in Sec. V we briefly examine the interesting question of what happens when multiplane waves act on the orbiting electron. As should be evident from Refs. H2085113–15H20852, this simple classical hydrogen problem presents a rich range of interesting nonlinear phenomena with just the simple consideration of a single electromagnetic plane wave acting. However, with multiple plane waves, the range of possibilities grows considerably wider, as illustrated in Sec. V. As shown there, jumplike behaviors are fairly easy to create. II. ANALYSIS OF INFINITE STABILITY CASE As discussed in Ref. H2085113H20852, when a classical electron of mass m and charge H11002e, follows a circular orbit of radius a about an infinitely massive and oppositely charged point nucleus, and when a CP plane wave is directed along the normal to the plane of the orbit, then by choosing the fre- quency of the plane wave to be equal to the orbital fre- quency, or H9275 c H11013(e 2 /ma 3 ) 1/2 , and by choosing the phase of the velocity of the electron and the electric field to be aligned with each other H20849i.e., make (H11002e)E to be in the same direc- tion as the velocity z ? ), then the amplitude A of the electric field of the plane wave can be chosen to perfectly balance the radiation reaction. The condition found was A c H11013 2e 3 H9275 c 3mc 3 a 2 H11005H20849H9275 c H9270H20850 e a 2 , H208491H20850 where H9270H110132e 2 /3mc 3 . However, we can generalize this very specific scenario and achieve similar conditions of perfect stability for the case when AH11022A c . Figure 1 illustrates the basic idea. By having the component of the force (H11002e)E from the plane wave in the xH11002y plane, of eA cos(H9251), to be equal and oppo- site to the radiation reaction, the angular frequency of the orbiting particle can stay constant. Moreover, by allowing a slightly different angular frequency in the orbiting motion from what would occur if the particle was only under the influence of the Coulombic binding potential, so that now we allow H9275HS11005H9275 c , then an orbit of constant radius a can be main- tained. Being more specific, we can write the nonrelativistic H20849NRH20850 equations of motion in polar coordinates as mH20849r ¨ ÀrH9258 ? 2 H20850H11005H11002 e 2 r 2 H110012H9270e 2 r ? r 3 H11001eA sinH20849H9258H11002H9275tH11002H9251H20850, H208492H20850 and mH20849rH9258 ¨ H110012r ?

H11005H9275, H9258 ¨ H110050; then our NR approximation to F reac reduces to F reac H11005H11002H9258 ˆ H9270e 2 H9275 a 2 H11005H11002H9258 ˆ H20849H9275H9270H20850 e 2 a 2 H11005H11002H9258 ˆ H20873 H9275 H9275 c H20874 eA c . H208495H20850 Thus, the radiation reaction only occurs in the tangential di- rection for circular motion. It is clearly a very small force, since H9270H110156.3H1100310 H1100224 sec, H9275H110154.5H1100310 16 sec H110021 for a H110050.5 Å,so(H9275H9270)H110152.8H1100310 H110027 , while e/a 2 H110151.9H1100310 7 stat- volt is the magnitude of the Coulombic electrostatic field from the classical nucleus acting on the orbiting electron. Equations H208492H20850 and H208493H20850 reduce to mH9275 2 aH11005 e 2 a 2 H11001eA sinH20849H9251H20850, H208496H20850 0H11005H11002 H20873 H9275 H9275 c H20874 eA c H11001eA cosH20849H9251H20850. H208497H20850 Hence we have two equations and two unknowns, namely, H9251 and H9275. Solving for H9275 yields the quadratic equation H9275 4 H110022H9275 2 H9275 c 2 H20875 1H11002 H20849H9270H9275 c H20850 2 2 H20876 H11001H9275 c 4 H20873 1H11002 A 2 A c 2 H20849H9275 c H9270H20850 2 H20874 H110050, H208498H20850 which can readily be solved to obtain H9275 2 H11005H9275 c 2 H20877 1H11002 H20849H9270H9275 c H20850 2 2 H11006H20849H9270H9275 c H20850 H20875 A 2 A c 2 H110021H11001 H20849H9270H9275 c H20850 2 4 H20876 1/2 H20878 . H208499H20850 This solution is exact for our nonrelativistic case. To low- est order in (H9270H9275 c ), and where A/A c is not just a very small fraction slightly larger than unity, then we can expand the above in terms of the small (H9275 c H9270) parameter to obtain H9275 2 H11015H9275 c 2 H20877 1H11006H20849H9270H9275 c H20850 H20873 A 2 A c 2 H110021 H20874 1/2 H20878 , H2084910H20850 where terms of order OH20851(H9275H9270 c ) 2 H20852 have been dropped. Turning to Eq. H208497H20850, we obtain H9251H11005cos H110021 H20873 A c A H9275 H9275 c H20874 . H2084911H20850 This result yields the exact value of H9251. We of course assume AH11091A c . As for the H11006 signs in Eqs. H208499H20850 and H2084910H20850, one can show upon substituting back into Eqs. H208497H20850 and H208496H20850 that one needs to use the plus sign when 0H11088H9251H11021H9266/2, and to use the minus sign when H11002H9266/2H11021H9251H110210. It should be noted that when H9266/2 H11088H9251H11088H9266,orH11002H9266/2H11088H9251H11088H11002H9266, then the radiation reaction can- not be balanced by (H11002e)E H20851see Eq. H208497H20850 or refer to Fig. 1H20852 and infinite t d is then not possible. Thus, for each value of A, when AH11022A c , there are two frequencies that we will call H9275 H11001 and H9275 H11002 , corresponding to the H11006 signs in Eq. H208499H20850, and the two corresponding angles from Eq. H2084911H20850 that we will call H9251 H11001 and H9251 H11002 , such that a perfect circular orbit can be maintained indefinitely for this idealistic situation. In Fig. 1, all vectors (H11002e)E that can yield infinite stability lie in the top half semicircle (H11002H9266/2 H11021H9251H11021H11001H9266/2). From Eq. H2084911H20850, H9251 H11001 H11005H11002H9251 H11002 . In Fig. 1, H9251 H11001 would be directed as shown, so H9251 H11001 H110220, with (H11002e)E tilted to the left of the velocity v. The corresponding angular fre- quency of H9275 H11001 would satisfy H9275 H11001 H11022H9275 c , where H9275 c is the an- gular frequency when H9251H110050 and AH11005A c . Likewise, H9251 H11002 would be directed in Fig. 1 such that H9251 H11002 H110210, or, (H11002e)E is tilted to the right of the velocity v, with the corresponding angular frequency of H9275 H11002 being such that H9275 H11002 H11021H9275 c . The differences between H9275 H11002 , H9275 c , and H9275 H11001 are in general quite small, since the dimensionless quantity of (H9275 c H9270)is such a small number for most atomic radii of interest in Eqs. H208499H20850 and H2084910H20850. For aH110050.5 Å,(H9275 c H9270)H110052.8H1100310 H110027 , so for this radius, H9275 H11001 , H9275 H11002 , and H9275 c differ in the seventh decimal place for AH1100510 statvolt, the fifth decimal place for AH11005100 stat- volt, the fourth decimal place for AH110051000 statvolt, and the third decimal place for AH1100580 000 statvolt. Likewise, whether one used H9275 H11001 , H9275 c ,orH9275 H11002 in Eq. H2084911H20850 will have a correspondingly small effect on H9251 H11002 and H9251 H11002 , with the most significant factor again being that H9251 H11001 H11005H11002H9251 H11002 . FIG. 1.

H208499H20850 holds, and we obtain H9275H11005H9275 c and H9251H110050, as expected. Moreover, since for reasonable values of AH11022A c such that (H9270H9275 c )(A/A c )H112701, then H9275 H11001 H11015H9275 H11002 H11015H9275 c , so our exact NR re- sult of Eq. H2084911H20850 reduces to H9251 H11006 H11015cos H110021 (A c /A), with H9251 H11001 H11005 H11002H9251 H11002 . What is interesting about these two solutions for a perfect circular orbit is that the H9275 H11001 solutions, with H9266/2H11021H9251 H11001 H110880, form what we will call ‘‘stable solutions,’’ meaning that if one makes H9251 or H9275 slightly lesser or greater than the pre- scribed values of H9251 H11001 and H9275 H11001 , then one can still obtain a very long time before decay occurs; hence, t d , although no longer infinite, will still be large. In contrast, the H9275 H11002 solu- tions, with 0H11021H9251 H11002 H11021H11002H9266/2, form what we will call ‘‘unstable solutions,’’ meaning that if one makes H9251 or H9275 slightly lesser or greater than the prescribed values of H9251 H11002 and H9275 H11002 , then near immediate decay in the orbit begins. This result occurs even though the precise values of H9251 H11002 and H9275 H11002 provide an orbit with an infinite value of t d . The contrast seems fasci- nating, and will be discussed more in the following section involving detailed simulation results. III. SIMULATION STUDY OF T d In Ref. H2085115H20852, simulation results were shown illustrating the very large range of t d that can exist, simply by changing H9251, while holding A fixed. Figure 2 illustrates the typical type of results found, this time for AH11005300 statvolt and H9251H11005H11002H9266/4. We will define t d precisely to be the point indicated in Fig. 2H20849bH20850, which seems to be a key characteristic of the onset of orbital decay, namely, where the radial oscillation only rises to about the halfway point of previous oscillations, then starts to undergo a steady, oscillatory decline. Using this definition of t d , Fig. 3 shows our simulation results after carrying out calculations as in Fig. 2 for a range of values of H9251, and for a range of values of A. These calcu- lations were carried out for one frequency value of the ap- plied CP plane wave, namely, H9275 c . More specifically, all tra- jectories were started in a circular orbit with aH110050.5 Å, with an applied CP plane wave with the indicated value of A and H9251 as in Fig. 3, and with an angular frequency H9275 H11005(e 2 /ma 3 ) 1/2 . This is the proper frequency for a constant circular orbit H20849in the NR approximationH20850 if either H208491H20850 no ra- diation reaction existed and no CP plane wave existed or H208492H20850 if radiation reaction existed, but AH11005A c and H9251H110050. Four values of H9251 H11001 , from Eq. H2084911H20850, corresponding to the values of AH110055.419, 6.0, 10, and 1000 statvolt are labeled in this diagram. As can be seen, they fall at the center of the peaks of the t d vs H9251 curves. If the plane waves had the precise values of H9275H11005H9275 H11001 from Eq. H208499H20850, then t d would indeed be infinite H20849we have also confirmed this point via specific simulation testingH20850. However, the simulations in Fig. 3 were carried out with the very slightly different value of H9275H11005H9275 c in the CP plane wave, so, the peaks of t d vs H9251 for these curves do not appear to be infinite, but, they are indeed very large and sharply peaked, and rather difficult to find exactly by pure simulation methods. Moreover, in correspondence with the earlier comments made about the unstable peak at H9275 H11002 and H9251 H11002 , no sign of the predicted infinite t d peak shows up in Fig. 3, since H9275 in the plane wave expressions was not taken to be H9275 H11002 , but rather the slightly different value of H9275 c . We should mention that our simulation testing of the unstable peak at H9275 H11002 and H9251 H11002 does reveal its existence for each value of A, but, one needs to increase the precision of the numerical calculations to track the particle orbit out to larger time values; the higher the precision imposed, the farther out in time the simulation predicts before decay begins. It certainly appears that the t d vs H9251 curves do peak at H9275 H11002 ,H9251 H11002 , for each value of A, but the shape of this peak appears as that of a near H9254-function. FIG. 2. H20849aH20850 r vs t for the classical electron in the scheme starting in the orbital condition of Fig. 1, with AH11005300 statvolt and H9251H11005 H11002H9266/4. The pattern shown here is fairly typical, namely, the ampli- tude of the radial oscillations gradually increase, the period also gradually increases H20851better seen in Fig. 2H20849bH20850H20852, until finally orbital decay sets in H20849bH20850 A blown-up view is shown of the r vs t curve in H20849aH20850, near the point where orbital decay sets in t d , as indicated, is defined in this paper as the point where the radial oscillation only rises to about the halfway point of previous oscillations, before beginning a steady, oscillatory decline. Up until the decay point, the period and amplitude of the oscillation gradually increases. The peaks change shape due to the nonlinear behavior, until finally the transition occurs. After the transition, the oscillations become smaller and smaller. D. C. COLE AND Y. ZOU PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68, 0666XX H208492003H20850 0666XX-4   PROOF COPY [EE8970] 181312PRE     PROOF COPY [EE8970] 181312PRE     PROOF COPY [EE8970] 181312PRE   Clearly, the behavior of t d near the H9275 H11002 ,H9251 H11002 peaks is consid- erably different from the regions near the H9275 H11001 ,H9251 H11001 peaks. Figure 4 helps to clarify the points made about the H9275 H11002 ,H9251 H11002 solutions. This figure contains our results for r vs t based on numerically solving Eqs. H208492H20850 and H208493H20850 for aH110050.5 Å and AH110051000 statvolt. As proven in Sec. II, the H9275 H11002 ,H9251 H11002 result should be exactly rH110050.5 Å for all t. However, as can be seen, the numerical predictions do not yield this result very easily. Here we followed the adaptive time-step Burlisch- Stoer algorithm, as described in Ref. H2085122H20852, which we have found to be an extremely good algorithm to use when one plane wave is present. H20849All of our single plane wave numeri- cal results reported here, and in Refs. H2085113–15H20852, used this algorithm.H20850 The labels on the curves of ‘‘exp(H1100215),’’ etc., indicate the relative precision we imposed on each step of the algorithm. As can be seen, even when huge increases in numerical precision were imposed, from exp(H1100215) to exp(H1100230), the simulation only yielded rH110150.5 Å up to about 4H1100310 H1100214 sec, which is about 280 orbits; after that, the radius changed rapidly to about 0.492 Å, and then a steady oscillatory radial decay began. In contrast, for the corre- sponding H9251 H11001 ,H9275 H11001 solution, even after 5H1100310 H1100213 sec we found that the radius only fluctuated in value in the seventh decimal place when only a numerical precision of exp (H1100220) was imposed. Clearly, any ‘‘noise’’ present, such as from numerical imprecision, then the H9251 H11002 ,H9275 H11002 result will not be obtained, whereas the H9251 H11001 ,H9275 H11001 solution is far more easily approximated. Some other interesting characteristics can be noted from Fig. 3. First, there are four peaks shown, corresponding to AH110055.419, 6.0, 10, and 1000 statvolt. For any fixed value of t d , the widths of these peaks become increasingly broader, when the value of A larger becomes. For example, for t d H110055.0H1100310 H1100211 sec, the width of the AH11005A c peak H20851i.e., the one indicated at 5.419 statvolt, from Eq. H208491H20850H20852 is zero, so this peak has the character of a H9254 function. In turn, the angular widths of the AH110055.419, 6.0, 10, and 1000 statvolt curves at t d H110055.0H1100310 H1100211 sec in Fig. 3 become increasingly wider with increasing A, being approximately 0, 0.07H9266, 0.16H9266, and 0.30H9266, respectively. Second, the t d vs H9251 curves for increasing values of A become increasingly more alike. For example, although not shown, we report here that the AH1100580 000 statvolt curve looks nearly identical to the eye to the AH110051000 statvolt curve; only by zooming in somewhat would one detect a difference. Indeed, from Eqs. H2084911H20850 and H208499H20850 one can prove that H9251 H11001 ?H11001H9266/2 as A?H11009. Evidently, the shape of the t d vs H9251 curve for H9275H11005H9275 c , as in Fig. 3, also goes to a limiting shape as A increases. Third, it is interesting to note that for large values of A the places of t d H110150 are near H9251H11005H11002H9266/2. For smaller values of A, such as for AH110056 statvolt in Fig. 3, a region of values of H9251 exist where t d H110220; however, outside this region, one can see that t d H110150, meaning that immediate decay sets in at the start of the simulation. In Fig. 3, the region of nonzero t d values for AH110056 statvolt extents roughly from H9251H11005H110020.14H9266 to H9251 H110050.33H9266. It is interesting to note that the results from simu- lation of points where t d curves go to zero on the left side of each peak, appear close in value to the position of the un- stable infinite t d peaks for H9251 H11002 , H9275 H11002 that can be calculated analytically. FIG. 3. Plot of t d vs H9251, for several conditions of AH110055.419, 6.0, 10, and 1000 statvolt. The points indicated along the curves were the ones actually calculated, using the method of Fig. 2H20849bH20850. The dotted lines drawn were curve fits, put in to simply illustrate the trends better here. As analyzed in Sec. II, each of the curves have a near infinite peak for t d . The peaks were drawn in here knowing their proper location from the analysis in Sec.

The conditions imposed on the CP plane wave were AH110051000 statvolt, along with the values of H9251 H11002 and H9275 H11002 as calculated from Eqs. H2084911H20850 and H208499H20850. The adaptive time-step Burlisch-Stoer algorithm from Ref. H2085122H20852 was used to compute r vs t for the different indicated relative precision conditions. As can be seen, even when a relative precision of exp(H1100230) was imposed, the algorithm still only predicted that rH110150.5 Å up to about 4H1100310 H1100214 sec, whereas the analytic solution predicts that rH110050.5 Å for all time.

Sati1,2,? 1Michigan Center for Theoretical Physics Randall Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, MI 48109–1120, USA 2Department of Pure Mathematics and Department of Physics University of Adelaide Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia Abstract We perform a one-loop test of the holographic interpretation of the Karch- Randall model, whereby a massive graviton appears on an AdS4 brane in an AdS5 bulk. Within the AdS/CFT framework, we examine the quantum corrections to the graviton propagator on the brane, and demonstrate that they induce a graviton mass in exact agreement with the Karch-Randall re- sult. Interestingly enough, at one loop order, the spin 0, spin 1/2 and spin 1 loops contribute to the dynamically generated (mass)2 in the same 1 : 3 : 12 ratio as enters the Weyl anomaly and the 1/r3 corrections to the Newtonian gravitational potential.

INTRODUCTION An old question is whether the graviton could have a small but non-zero rest mass. If so, it is unlikely to be described by the explicit breaking of general covariance that results from the addition of a Pauli-Fierz mass term to the Einstein Lagrangian. This gives rise to the well-known Van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov [1,2] discontinuity problems in the massless limit, that come about by jumping from five degrees of freedom to two. Moreover, recent attempts [3,4] to circumvent the discontinuity in the presence of a non-zero cosmological constant work only at tree level and the discontinuity re-surfaces1 at one loop [6]. On the other hand, in analogy with spontaneously broken gauge theories, one might therefore prefer a dynamical breaking of general covariance, which would be expected to yield a smooth limit. However, a conventional Higgs mechanism, in which a scalar field acquires a non-zero expectation value, does not yield a mass for the graviton. The remaining possibility is that the graviton acquires a mass dynamically and that the would-be Goldstone boson is a spin one bound state. Just such a possibility was suggested in 1975 [7]. Interestingly enough, the idea of a massive graviton arising from a spin one bound state Goldstone boson has recently been revived by Porrati [8] in the context of the Karch-Randall brane-world [9] whereby our universe is an AdS4 brane embedded in an AdS5 bulk. This model predicts a small but finite four-dimensional graviton mass M2 = 3L 2 5 2L44, (1) in the limit L4 ? ?, where L4 and L5 are the ‘radii’ of AdS4 and AdS5, respectively. From the Karch-Randall point of view, the massive graviton bound to the brane arises from solving the classical D = 5 linearized gravity equations in the brane background [9]. Furthermore, holography of the Karch-Randall model [10,11] consistently predicts an identical graviton mass. In a previous paper [12], the complementarity between the Maldacena AdS/CFT corre- spondence [13–15] and the Randall-Sundrum [16] Minkowski braneworld picture was put to the test by calculating the 1/r3 corrections to the Newtonian gravitational potential arising from the CFT loop corrections to the graviton propagator. At one loop we have [17] V(r) = G4m1m2r parenleftbigg 1 + ?G4r2 parenrightbigg , (2) where G4 is the four-dimensional Newton’s constant, ? = 145?(12n1 + 3n1/2 +n0), (3) and wheren0, n1/2 andn1 count the number of (real) scalars, (Majorana) spinors and vectors in the multiplet. The coefficient ? is the same one that determines that part of the Weyl 1A similar quantum discontinuity arises in the “partially massless” limit as a result of jumping from five degrees of freedom to four [5]. 2 anomaly involving the square of the Weyl tensor [18]. The fields on the brane are given by N = 4 supergravity coupled to a N = 4 super-Yang-Mills CFT with gauge group U(N), for which (n1,n1/2,n0) = (N2,4N2,6N2). Using both the AdS/CFT relation, N2 = ?L53/2G5, and the brane world relation, G4 = 2G5/L5, we find G4? = G4L5 3 3G5 = 2L52 3 , (4) where G5 is the five-dimensional Newton’s constant. Hence V(r) = G4m1m2r parenleftbigg 1 + 2L5 2 3r2 parenrightbigg , (5) which agrees exactly with the Randall-Sundrum bulk result. This complementarity can be generalized to the Karch-Randall AdS braneworld picture. From an AdS/CFT point of view, one may equally well foliate a Poincar´e patch of AdS5 in AdS4 slices. The Karch-Randall brane is then such a slice that cuts off the AdS5 bulk. However, unlike for the Minkowski braneworld, this cutoff is not complete, and part of the original AdS5 boundary remains [9,11]. Starting with a maximally supersymmetric gauged N = 8 supergravity in the five dimensional bulk, the result is a gauged N = 4 supergravity on the brane coupled to a N = 4 super-Yang-Mills CFT with gauge group U(N), however with unusual boundary conditions on the CFT fields [10,11,19,8,20]. As was demonstrated in Ref. [8], the CFT on AdS4 provides a natural origin for the bound state Goldstone boson which turns out to correspond to a massive representation of SO(3,2). However, while Ref. [8] considers the case of coupling to a single conformal scalar, in this paper we provide a crucial test of the complementarity by computing the dynamically generated graviton mass induced by a complete N = 4 super-Yang-Mills CFT on the brane and showing that this quantum computation correctly reproduces the Karch-Randall result, (1). We begin in section 2 by discussing properties of the graviton propagator and providing a general framework for the dynamical generation of graviton mass. In section 3, we introduce homogeneous coordinates, and set up the loop computation, which we carry out in section 4. Finally, in section 5, we recover the Karch-Randall graviton mass, (1), from the from the quantum CFT perspective. II. TRANSVERSALITY AND THE GRAVITON MASS We are mainly interested in the properties of the one-loop graviton self-energy, ?µ?,??(x,y). As emphasized in Refs. [7,8], mass generation is compatible with the gravita- tional Ward identity arising from diffeomorphism invariance. Thus the self-energy remains transverse, ?µx?µ?,?? = ??y?µ?,?? = 0. One is then able to write ? as a non-local expression evaluated at point xµ, compatible with transversality ?µ?,??(x) = ?(?)?µ?,??(?) +?(?)Kµ?,??(?), (6) where [8] 3 ?µ??? = ??µ??? ? 13gµ?g?? + 2?µ parenleftBigg?? ? +??? ?/2? ??2? parenrightBigg ?? ??3(gµ? + 3??µ??) 13??4?(g?? + 3?????) (7) is the transverse-traceless projection and Kµ??? = ???3??4?dµ?d??; dµ? = gµ? + 1????µ?? (8) is the transverse but trace projection. More generally, (?+K)µ??? = ??µ??? + 2??2???µ???? + 1(??2?)(???)?µ??????, (9) is an overall transverse projection, regardless of trace. Here, ? = ?3/L24 is the four- dimensional cosmological constant and ? is the general Lichnerowicz operator which com- mutes with covariant derivatives. Symmetrization on (µ?) and (??) is implied throughout. In flat space, these expressions reduce simply to the familiar ?µ??? = d?µd?? ? 13dµ?d??, K??µ? = 13dµ?d?? (10) where dµ? = ?µ? ? ?µ??. (11) In Feynman gauge, the tree-level massless graviton propagator in AdS takes the form Dµ??? = 1??2?(??µ??? ? 12gµ?g??). (12) Using the self-energy written in the form (6), the quantum corrected propagator may be summed to yield tildewiderDµ??? = 1 ??2??? parenleftbigg ??µ??? ? ???3??4?gµ?g?? parenrightbigg ? 1??? +?/2 parenleftbigg1 2 ??? 3??4?gµ?g ?? parenrightbigg (13) when evaluated between conserved sources. This indicates that a constant piece in the traceless self-energy, ? = ?M2, will shift the spin-2 pole in the propagator, thus yielding a non-zero graviton mass. The second term, involving the trace, may combine with the scalar part of the first. However a potentially dangerous scalar ghost pole at 3? = 4? may appear. This ghost is absent whenever the residue of the pole vanishes, i.e. provided ? = ?|4?=3?. This is in fact the case, as may be seen by explicit computation below. Although the field theory is conformal, the presence of K is demanded by the Weyl anomaly [18]. However, this trace piece is entirely contained in the local part of ?, and does not contribute directly to the mass. The net result is a pure massive spin-2 propagator tildewiderDµ??? = 1 ??2? +M2 parenleftbigg ??µ??? ? 12 parenleftBigg2??2M2 2??3M2 parenrightBigg gµ?g?? parenrightbigg , (14) where we have taken ? = ?M2 and the Pauli-Fierz combination, ? = (3/?)(???)?. Thus the procedure we follow in determining the graviton mass is to compute the one- loop self-energy in an AdS background, and to identify the appropriate constant piece ?. Viewed in coordinate space, this is a non-local contribution to ?. But this is precisely what is necessary to induce a graviton mass. 4 III. HOMOGENEOUS COORDINATES AND BI-TENSORS Before turning to an explicit calculation of the graviton self energy, we consider some preliminaries for studying quantum fields in homogeneous spaces. In particular, we estab- lish our notation and review some useful facts about manipulating tensors in homogeneous space. Many of these techniques are by now standard; further details may be found in, e.g., Refs. [21–25]. We find it convenient to work in homogeneous coordinates, which corresponds to the embedding of AdS4 in R5 with pseudo-Euclidean metric, ?MN = diag(?,+,+,+,?). AdS4 is then given by the restriction to the hyperboloid XMXN?MN = ?L24. Note that we denote homogeneous coordinates as XM,YM,... (M,N = 0,...,4) and intrinsic coordinates as xµ,yµ,... (µ,? = 0,...,3). Tensor fields ?MNP···(X) restricted to the hyperboloid must satisfy XM?MNP···(X) = 0. In addition, we take them to be homogeneous of (arbitrary) degree n, ?MNP···(?X) = ?n?MNP···(X). An important point to note in transforming from intrinsic coordinates to homogeneous coordinates is that all tensor indices must be restricted to lie on the hyper- boloid, namely XM?MNP···(X) = 0. Projecting into the tangent direction at a point XM is accomplished by the operator GMN(X) = ?MN +XMXN/L2 (15) which also serves as a metric tensor where Tr(G) ?GMNGMN = 4 (recall that X2 = ?L2). Two-point functions in coordinate space are in general bi-tensor functions of the points XM and YP. Maximally symmetric scalar functions, ?(X,Y), are simple and can only depend on the invariant |X ? Y|2/L2 = ?2(Z + 1) where Z = X ·Y/L2. However, in general, we must also consider bi-tensors of the form, ?MN···,PQ···(X,Y), where the first (second) set of indices refer to point XM (YP). To construct such bi-tensors, we define the unit vectors NM(X) = YM +ZXML?Z2 ?1 , NP(Y) = XP +ZYPL?Z2 ?1 (16) where, as before, Z = X ·Y/L2. These serve the same purpose as the unit tangent vectors of [22], except that here they are given in homogeneous coordinates. In addition, we also make use of the mixed tensor ˆGMP(X,Y) = GMN(X)?NQGPQ(Y) = ?MP + (XMXP +YMYP +ZXMYP)/L2. (17) This serves the same function as the ‘parallel propagator’ of Ref. [22]. However, when converted from intrinsic coordinates, the parallel propagator has the form gMP = ˆGMP ? (Z + 1)NMNP, which differs at large separations. We choose to use ˆGMP because it is symmetric under the anti-podal map Y ? ?Y in the covering space of AdS, while gMP is not. It is clear from the condition of maximal symmetry that all bi-tensors may be expressed in terms of the metrics GMN(X), GPQ(Y), unit vectors NM(X), NP(Y), and mixed ten- sor ˆGMP(X,Y). For the graviton self energy, we are interested in the two point function, 5

Instituto de F´?sica Te´orica, Universidade Estadual Paulista Rua Pamplona 145, 01405-900, S˜ao Paulo, SP, Brasil and Edward Witten# School of Natural Sciences, Institute for Advanced Study Princeton NJ 08540, USA Conformal supergravity arises in presently known formulations of twistor-string theory ei- ther via closed strings or via gauge-singlet open strings. We explore this sector of twistor- string theory, relating the relevant string modes to the particles and fields of conformal supergravity. We use the twistor-string theory to compute some tree level scattering am- plitudes with supergravitons. Since the supergravitons interact with the same coupling constant as the Yang-Mills fields, conformal supergravity states will contribute to loop amplitudes of Yang-Mills gluons in these theories. Those loop amplitudes will therefore not coincide with the loop amplitudes of pure super Yang-Mills theory. * e-mail: nberkovi@ift.unesp.br, # e-mail: witten@ias.edu June 2004 1. Introduction The most commonly studied supergravity theories are “Einstein” supergravity theo- ries, in which the gravitational part of the action, in n dimensions, is integraltext dnx?gR, with R the Ricci scalar. These theories are not special to four dimensions; they exist up to eleven dimensions [1]. In four dimensions, there also exist conformally invariant supergravity theories (see [2] for a review), in which the gravitational part of the action is integraltext d4x?gW2, with W the Weyl tensor. Such theories are special to four dimensions, in the following sense. In n dimensions, the conformally invariant expression would be integraltext dnx?gWn/2. Precisely for n = 4, this expression becomes quadratic in W and gives a nondegenerate kinetic energy for the gravitational field. This simple observation suggests that four-dimensional conformal supergravity the- ories might be relevant to the real world – perhaps with the aid of some mechanism of spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance. However, they in fact are generally consid- ered to be an unsuitable starting point for describing nature, because they lead to fourth order differential equations for the fluctuations of the metric, and thus to a lack of unitar- ity. We have no reason to question these beliefs and we will later describe some facts that illustrate them. The usual string theories are not conformally invariant in the target space, and give at low energies Einstein supergravity rather than conformal supergravity. Twistor-string theory [3,4] is clearly different; superconformal invariance in spacetime is built in, and thus any form of supergravity that emerges will be conformal supergravity. The first indicationthat conformal supergravity arises in twistor-string theory was pre- sented in section 5.1 of [3], where it was shown that tree level gluon scattering amplitudes contain, in additional to the single-trace Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes, multi-trace terms that reflect the exchange of conformal supergravitons. At tree level, it is possible to recover the pure Yang-Mills scattering by extracting the single-trace amplitudes. However, at the loop level, diagrams that include conformal supergravitons can generate single-trace interactions, so the presence of conformal supergravity apparently means that it will be dif- ficult with presently known forms of twistor-string theory to compute Yang-Mills or super Yang-Mills amplitudes beyond tree level. In twistor-string theory, conformal supergravi- tons have the same coupling constant as gauge bosons, so it is not possible to remove the 1 conformal supergravity contributions to scattering amplitudes by going to weak coupling.1 Since Yang-Mills theory makes sense without conformal supergravity, it is plausible that a version of twistor-string theory might exist that does not generate conformal supergrav- ity and would be useful for computing Yang-Mills loop amplitudes. It would be highly desireable to find such a theory, though at the moment it is not clear how to do so. The occurrence of conformal supergravity in twistor-string theory seems interesting and unusual enough to be worthy of study, even though conformal supergravity appears not to be physically sensible. In this paper, we consider two alternative versions of twistor- string theory based on theB-model of CP3|4 [3] and based on a certain construction involv- ing open strings [4]. Since gravity usually arises in the closed string sector, the appearance of conformal supergravity in the open version of twistor-string theory is somewhat unex- pected. (It would also be interesting to reconsider some of the issues using a more recent alternative twistor-string proposal [5], as well as the twistor-string proposal of [6].) We consider various issues involving conformal supergravity in the two models, show- ing how rather similar results arise from different origins. In sections 2 and 3, we analyze the spectrum of the theory first in twistor space and then in Minkowski spacetime. In sec- tion 4, we discuss the linearized spectrum of conformal supergravity and compare to the twistor-string results. In section 5, we use the twistor-string theory to compute some tree amplitudes including conformal supergravitons. In section 6, we discuss some properties of the nonlinear conformal supergravity action. Finally, in section 7, we analyze anomalies that apparently lead to restrictions on the gauge group. Our discussion in section 7 is somewhat inconclusive. 2. Vertex Operators In this section, we will describe the twistor-string vertex operators. First we consider the “open string” version of twistor-string theory [4], and then we consider the B-model of CP3|4 [3]. 1 To be more precise, in one approach to twistor-string theory [3] this is true as stated, while in the other approach [4], as we discuss in section 7, the ratio of the gravitational and gauge coupling constants is proportional to k, the level of the current algebra. Unitarity requires k ? 1, but if it makes sense to relax unitarity, one could conceivably decouple conformal gravity in the limit k ? 0. 2 2.1. “Open String” Version In the open version of the twistor string, the worldsheet action is S = integraldisplay d2z(YI?AZI +YI?AZI +SC). (2.1) Here, assuming a Euclidean signature worldsheet,2 ZI are homogeneous coordinates of CP3|4, ZI are their complex conjugates, and Y and Y are variables conjugate to Z and Z, respectively. Z and Z have conformal dimensions (0,0), while Y and Y have dimensions (1,0) and (0,1). A is a worldsheet gauge field that gauges the GL(1,C) symmetry ZI ? tZI, YI ? t?1YI. SC is the action for an additional system with c = 28. We assume that this includes a current algebra of some group G, which will become a gauge group in spacetime, and we refer to the variables in SC as current algebra variables. For the open string, ZI = ZI, YI = YI (2.2) on the boundary. On the boundary, the gauge group GL(1,C) (or GL(1,R)2 in the case of a Lorentz signature worldsheet, as remarked in the footnote) is broken to GL(1,R), the group of real scalings of Z and Z that preserve the boundary condition. Physical states are described by dimension one fields or vertex operators that are neutral under GL(1) and moreover are primary fields with respect to the Virasoro and GL(1) generators. These generators are T = YI?ZI +TC, J = YIZI, (2.3) whereTC is thec = 28 stress tensor for the current algebra. We consider mainly open string vertex operators. The boundary condition (2.2) means that open string vertex operators can be expressed in terms of Z and Y and the current algebra variables, and not Z and Y; moreover, by virtue of the boundary condition, Z and Y are real on the boundary. (For a Lorentz signature worldsheet, Z and Y are real even away from the boundary, as noted in the footnote.) 2 With a Lorentz signature worldsheet, one can alternatively treat ZI as homogeneous co- ordinates of RP3|4, and ZI as homogeneous coordinates of a second RP3|4. The gauge group is GL(1,R)×GL(1,R), with separate real scalings of Z and Z. The open string boundary condition is the same, ZI = ZI, and the open string vertex operators are accordingly also the same. 3 The most obvious primary fields are the dimension zero fields ?(ZI), with ? being any function that is invariant under GL(1,R) scalings of ZI (in other words, ? is invariant under Z ?tZ for real t); equivalently, ? is any function on RP3|4. By multiplying such a field by any of the currents jr, r = 1,...,dimG of the current algebra, we can construct Yang-Mills vertex operators, which of course should have dimension 1: V? = jr?r(Z). (2.4) These vertex operators were discussed in [4] in reproducing some of the results of [3] and [7]. With equal ease, one can construct the vertex operators that turn out to describe conformal supergravity. An expression linear in either Y or ?Z has dimension 1. So the following operators have dimension 1: Vf = YIfI(Z), Vg = gI(Z)?ZI. (2.5) These are in addition GL(1)-invariant iffI carries GL(1) charge 1 (that is, under Z ?tZ, it scales as f ?tf) and gI carries GL(1) charge ?1 (it scales as g ?t?1g). To be primary fields with respect to J and T, fI and gI must satisfy ?IfI = 0, ZIgI = 0. (2.6) Furthermore, fI and gI have the gauge invariances ?fI = ZI?, ?gI = ?I? (2.7) since YIZI? = J?1? and ?ZI?I? = T?1?. These conditions have a simple interpretation. Since fI has charge 1, the expression ? = fI ??ZI (2.8) is invariant under scaling. The equivalence relation ?fI = ZI? means that ? can be interpreted as a vector field on RP3|4 (and not on the ambient R4|4). The constraint ?IfI = 0 means that it is a volume-preserving vector field. In the case of g, the natural expression is the one-form ? = gIdZI. (2.9) The constraintgIZI = 0 means that ? is well-defined as a one-form on RP3|4 (and not just on R4|4). The gauge equivalence ?gI = ?I? means that g can be regarded as an abelian gauge field on RP3|4, not just a one-form. Of course, like the functions ?r in (2.4) that describe gauge fields in spacetime or the volume-preserving vector field fI, the abelian gauge field gJ is not constrained to obey any equation of motion. 4 
Fisica arXiv:hep-th/9603053 v1   8 Mar 1996 hep-th/9603053 Gravity coupled with matter and the foundation of non commutative geometry Alain CONNES I.H.E.S., 91440 Bures-sur-Yvette, France Abstract. We  rst exhibit in the commutative case the simple al- gebraic relations between the algebra of functions on a manifold and its in nitesimal length element ds. Its unitary representations cor- respond to Riemannian metrics and Spin structure while ds is the Dirac propagator ds = | = D 1 where D is the Dirac operator. We extend these simple relations to the non commutative case using Tomita’s involution J. We then write a spectral action, the trace of a function of the length element in Planck units, which when applied to the non commutative geometry of the Standard Model will be shown (in a joint work with Ali Chamseddine) to give the SM Lagrangian coupled to gravity. The internal  uctuations of the non commutative geometry are trivial in the commutative case but yield the full bosonic sector of SM with all correct quantum numbers in the slightly non commutative case. The group of local gauge transformations appears spontaneously as a normal subgroup of the di eomorphism group. Riemann’s concept of a geometric space is based on the notion of a manifold M whose points x2M are locally labelled by a  nite number of real coordinates x 2R. The metric data is given by the in nitesimal length element, (1) ds2 = g  dx dx  which allows to measure distances between two points x;y as the in mum of the 1 length of arcs x(t) from x to y, (2) d(x;y) = Inf Z y x ds: In this paper we shall build our notion of geometry, in a very similar but somehow dual manner, on the pair (A;ds) of the algebraA of coordinates and the in nite- simal length element ds. For the start we only consider ds as a symbol, which together with A generates an algebra (A;ds). The length element ds does not commute with the coordinates, i.e. with the functions f on our space, f 2A. But it does satisfy non trivial relations. Thus in the simplest case where A is commutative we shall have, (3)  [f;ds 1];g = 0 8f;g2A: The only other relation between ds andAis of degree n in ds 1 = D and expresses the homological nature of the volume form (see axiom 4 below). When A is commutative it has a spectrum, namely the space of algebra preserving maps from A to the complex numbers,  :A!C ;  (a +b) =  (a) + (b) ;  (ab) =  (a) (b) 8a;b2A;(4)  ( a) =   (a) 8 2C; 8a2A: For instance, when A is the algebra of functions on a space M the space of such maps, called characters ofA identi es with M. To each point x2M corresponds the character  x, (5)  x(f) = f(x) 8f2A: While relations such as (3) between the algebraAand the length elementdshold at the universal level, a speci c geometry will be speci ed as a unitary representation of the algebra generated byAand ds. In general we shall deal with complex valued functions f so that A will be endowed with an involution, (6) f!f  which is just complex conjugation of functions in the usual case, (7) f (x) = f(x) 8x2M: 2 The length element ds will be selfadjoint, (8) ds = ds so that (ds)2 will be automatically positive. The unitarity of the representation just means that the operator  (a ) correspon- ding to a is the adjoint of the operator  (a), (9)  (a ) =  (a) 8a2(A;ds): Given a unitary representation  of (A;ds) we measure the distance between two points x;y of our space by, (10) d(x;y) = Sup jf(x) f(y)j ; f2A; k[f;ds 1]k 1  where we dropped the letter  but where the representation  has been used in a crucial way to de ne the norm of [f;ds 1]. Before we proceed let us  rst explain what representation of (A;ds) corresponds to an ordinary Riemannian geometry, and check that (10) gives us back exactly the Riemannian geodesic distance of formula (2). The algebra A is the algebra of smooth complex valued functions on M, A= C1(M) and we choose to represent ds as the propagator for fermions which physicists write in a suggestive ways as  | . This means that we represent A in the Hilbert space L2(M;S) of square integrable sections of the spinor bundle on M by the following formula, (11) (f )(x) = f(x) (x) 8f2A= C1(M) ; 8 2H= L2(M;S) and we represent ds by the formula, (12) ds = D 1 ; D = 1p 1   r  where D is the Dirac operator. We ignore the ambiguity of (12) on the kernel of D. One checks immediately that the commutator [D;f], for f 2 A = C1(M) is the Cli ord multiplication by the gradient rf so that its operator norm, in H= L2(M;S), is given by (13) k[D;f]k= Sup x2M krfk: 3 It then follows by integration along the path from x to y that jf(x)  f(y)j  length of path, provided (13) is bounded by 1. Thus the equality between (10) and (2). Note that while ds has the dimension of a length, (ds) 1 which is represented by D has the dimension of a mass. The formula (10) is dual to formula (2). In the usual Riemannian case it gives the same answer but being dual it does not use arcs connecting x with y but rather functions from M to C. As we shall see this will allow to treat spaces with a  nite number of points on the same footing as the continuum. Another virtue of formula (10) is that it will continue to make sense when the algebra A is no longer commutative. In this paper we shall write down the axioms of geometry as the presentation of the algebraic relations betweenAand ds and the representation of those relations in Hilbert space. In order to compare di erent geometries, i.e. di erent representations of the alge- bra (A;ds) generated by A and ds, we shall use the following action functional, (14) Trace   ’  ds ‘p    where ‘p is the Planck length and ’ is a suitable cuto function which will cut o  all eigenvalues of ds larger than ‘p. We shall show in [CC] that for a suitable choice of the algebra A, the above action will give Einstein gravity coupled with the Lagrangian of the standard U(1) SU(2) SU(3) model of Glashow Weinberg Salam. The algebra will not be C1(M) with M a (compact) 4-manifold but a non commutative re nement of it which has to do with the quantum group re nement of the Spin covering of SO(4), (15) 1!Z=2!Spin(4)!SO(4)!1: Amazingly, in this description the group of gauge transformations of the matter  elds arises spontaneously as a normal subgroup of the generalized di eomorphism group Aut(A). It is the non commutativity of the algebra A which gives for free the group of gauge transformations of matter  elds as a (normal) subgroup of the group of dif- feomorphisms. Indeed, when A= C1(M) is the commutative algebra of smooth 4 functions on M one easily checks that the following de nes a one to one corre- spondence between di eomorphisms ’ of M and the automorphisms  2Aut(A) of the algebra A (preserving the  ), (16)  (f) (x) = f(’ 1(x)) 8x2M ; f2C1(M): In the non commutative case an algebra always has automorphisms, the inner automorphisms given by (17)  u(f) = ufu 8f2A for any element of the unitary group U of A, (18) U =fu2A ; uu = u u = 1g: The subgroup Int(A)  Aut(A) of inner automorphisms is a normal subgroup and it will provide us with our group of internal gauge transformations. It is a happy coincidence that the two terminologies : inner automorphisms and internal symmetries actually match. Both groups will have to be lifted to the spinors but we shall see that later. We shall see that the action of inner automorphisms on the metric gives rise to internal  uctuations of the latter which replace D by D + A + JAJ 1 (see below) and give exactly the gauge bosons of the standard model, with its symmetry breaking Higgs sector, when we apply it to the above  nite geometry. We had realized in [Co2] that the fermions were naturally in the adjoint representation of the unitary group U in the case of the standard model, i.e. that the action of U on H was,  !uJuJ 1 = u u : But we had not understood the signi cance of the inner automorphisms as in- ternal di eomorphisms of the non commutative space. What the present paper shows is that one should consider the internal gauge symmetries as part of the di eomorphism group of the non commutative geometry and the gauge bosons as the internal  uctuations of the metric. We should thus expect that the action functional should be of purely gravitational nature. The above spectral action when restricted to these special metrics will give the interaction Lagrangian of the bosons. The interaction with Fermions, which has the right hypercharge as- signement is obtained directly fromh ;D i (with D+A+JAJ 1 instead of D), 5

SAOUMA Dept. of Civil Environmental and Architectural Engineering University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309-0428 Draft 0–3 PREFACE Une des questions fondamentales que l’ing´enieur des Mat´eriaux se pose est de conna ˆ itre le comporte- ment d’un materiel sous l’e?et de contraintes et la cause de sa rupture. En d´efinitive, c’est pr´ecis´ement la r´eponse `a c/mat es deux questions qui vont guider le d´eveloppement de nouveaux mat´eriaux, et d´eterminer leur survie sous di?´erentes conditions physiques et environnementales. L’ing´enieur en Mat´eriaux devra donc poss´eder une connaissance fondamentale de la M´ecanique sur le plan qualitatif, et ˆetre capable d’e?ectuer des simulations num´eriques (le plus souvent avec les El´ements Finis) et d’en extraire les r´esultats quantitatifs pour un probl`eme bien pos´e. Selon l’humble opinion de l’auteur, ces nobles buts sont id´ealement atteints en trois ´etapes. Pour commencer, l’´el`eve devra ˆetre confront´eauxprincipesdebasedelaM´ecanique des Milieux Continus. Une pr´esentation d´etaill´ee des contraintes, d´eformations, et principes fondamentaux est essentiel. Par la suite une briefe introduction `a l’Elasticit´e(ainsiqu’`alath´eorie des poutres) convaincra l’´el`eve qu’un probl`eme g´en´eral bien pos´e peut avoir une solution analytique. Par contre, ceci n’est vrai (`a quelques exceptions prˆets) que pour des cas avec de nombreuses hypoth`eses qui simplifient le probl`eme (´elasticit´e lin´eaire, petites d´eformations, contraintes/d´eformations planes, ou axisymmetrie). Ainsi, la troisi`eme et derni`ere ´etape consiste en une briefe introduction `alaM´ecanique des Solides, et plus pr´ecis´ement au Calcul Variationel. A travers la m´ethode des Puissances Virtuelles, et celle de Rayleigh-Ritz, l’´el`eve sera enfin prˆet `a un autre cours d’´el´ements finis. Enfin, un sujet d’int´erˆet particulier aux ´etudiants en Mat´eriaux a ´et´eajout´e, `a savoir la R´esistance Th´eorique des Mat´eriaux cristallins. Ce sujet est capital pour une bonne compr´ehension de la rupture et servira de lien `aun´eventuel cours sur la M´ecanique de la Rupture. Ce polycopi´ea´et´eenti`erement pr´epar´e par l’auteur durant son ann´ee sabbatique `a l’Ecole Poly- technique F´ed´erale de Lausanne, D´epartement des Mat´eriaux. Le cours ´etait donn´eaux´etudiants en deuxi`eme ann´ee en Fran¸cais. Ce polycopi´ea´et´e´ecrit avec les objectifs suivants. Avant tout il doit ˆetre complet et rigoureux. A tout moment, l’´el`eve doit ˆetre `amˆeme de retrouver toutes les ´etapes suivies dans la d´erivation d’une ´equation. Ensuite, en allant `a travers toutes les d´erivations, l’´el`eve sera `amˆeme de bien conna ˆ itre les limitations et hypoth`eses derri`ere chaque model. Enfin, la rigueur scientifique adopt´ee, pourra servir d’exemple `a la solution d’autres probl`emes scientifiques que l’´etudiant pourrait ˆetre emmen´e`ar´esoudre dans le futur. Ce dernier point est souvent n´eglig´e. Le polycopi´e est subdivis´edefa¸con tr`es hi´erarchique. Chaque concept est d´evelopp´e dans un para- graphe s´epar´e. Ceci devrait faciliter non seulement la compr´ehension, mais aussi le dialogue entres ´elev´es eux-mˆemes ainsi qu’avec le Professeur. Quand il a ´et´ejug´en´ecessaire, un bref rappel math´ematique est introduit. De nombreux exemples sont pr´esent´es, et enfin des exercices solutionn´es avec Mathematica sont pr´esent´es dans l’annexe. L’auteur ne se fait point d’illusions quand au complet et `a l’exactitude de tout le polycopi´e. Il a ´et´e enti`erement d´evelopp´e durant une seule ann´ee acad´emique, et pourrait donc b´en´eficier d’une r´evision extensive. A ce titre, corrections et critiques seront les bienvenues. Enfin, l’auteur voudrait remercier ses ´elev´es qui ont diligemment suivis son cours sur la M´ecanique de Milieux Continus durant l’ann´ee acad´emique 1997-1998, ainsi que le Professeur Huet qui a ´et´eson hˆote au Laboratoire des Mat´eriaux de Construction de l’EPFL durant son s´ejour `a Lausanne. Victor Saouma Ecublens, Juin 1998 Draft 0–4 PREFACE One of the most fundamental question that a Material Scientist has to ask him/herself is how a material behaves under stress, and when does it break. Ultimately, it its the answer to those two questions which would steer the development of new materials, and determine their survival in various environmental and physical conditions. The Material Scientist should then have a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of Mechanics on the qualitative level, and be able to perform numerical simulation (most often by Finite Element Method) and extract quantitative information for a specific problem. In the humble opinion of the author, this is best achieved in three stages. First, the student should be exposed to the basic principles of Continuum Mechanics. Detailed coverage of Stress, Strain, General Principles, and Constitutive Relations is essential. Then, a brief exposure to Elasticity (along with Beam Theory) would convince the student that a well posed problem can indeed have an analytical solution. However, this is only true for problems problems with numerous simplifying assumptions (such as linear elasticity, small deformation, plane stress/strain or axisymmetry, and resultants of stresses). Hence, the last stage consists in a brief exposure to solid mechanics, and more precisely to Variational Methods. Through an exposure to the Principle of Virtual Work, and the Rayleigh-Ritz Method the student will then be ready for Finite Elements. Finally, one topic of special interest to Material Science students was added, and that is the Theoretical Strength of Solids. This is essential to properly understand the failure of solids, and would later on lead to a Fracture Mechanics course. These lecture notes were prepared by the author during his sabbatical year at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Lausanne) in the Material Science Department. The course was o?ered to second year undergraduate students in French, whereas the lecture notes are in English. The notes were developed with the following objectives in mind. First they must be complete and rigorous. At any time, a student should be able to trace back the development of an equation. Furthermore, by going through all the derivations, the student would understand the limitations and assumptions behind every model. Finally, the rigor adopted in the coverage of the subject should serve as an example to the students of the rigor expected from them in solving other scientific or engineering problems. This last aspect is often forgotten. The notes are broken down into a very hierarchical format. Each concept is broken down into a small section (a byte). This should not only facilitate comprehension, but also dialogue among the students or with the instructor. Whenever necessary, Mathematical preliminaries are introduced to make sure that the student is equipped with the appropriate tools. Illustrative problems are introduced whenever possible, and last but not least problem set using Mathematica is given in the Appendix. The author has no illusion as to the completeness or exactness of all these set of notes. They were entirely developed during a single academic year, and hence could greatly benefit from a thorough review. As such, corrections, criticisms and comments are welcome. Finally, the author would like to thank his students who bravely put up with him and Continuum Mechanics in the AY 1997-1998, and Prof. Huet who was his host at the EPFL. Victor E.

Fisica arXiv:hep-ph/9603402 v1   25 Mar 1996 ORNL-CTP-95-07 hep-ph/9603402 Singularity-Free Breit Equation from Constraint Two-Body Dirac Equations Horace W. Crater The University of Tennessee Space Institute, Tullahoma, Tennessee, 37388 Chun Wa Wong Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1547 Cheuk-Yin Wong Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6373 Abstract We examine the relation between two approaches to the quantum relativis- tic two-body problem: (1) the Breit equation, and (2) the two-body Dirac equations derived from constraint dynamics. In applications to quantum elec- trodynamics, the former equation becomes pathological if certain interaction terms are not treated as perturbations. The difficulty comes from singularities which appear at finite separations r in the reduced set of coupled equations for attractive potentials even when the potentials themselves are not singular there. They are known to give rise to unphysical bound states and resonances. In contrast, the two-body Dirac equations of constraint dynamics do not have these pathologies in many nonperturbative treatments. To understand these 1 marked differences we first express these contraint equations, which have an “external potential” form similar to coupled one-body Dirac equations, in a hyperbolic form. These coupled equations are then re-cast into two equiv- alent equations: (1) a covariant Breit-like equation with potentials that are exponential functions of certain “generator” functions, and (2) a covariant or- thogonality constraint on the relative momentum. This reduction enables us to show in a transparent way that finite-r singularities do not appear as long as the the exponential structure is not tampered with and the exponential generators of the interaction are themselves nonsingular for finite r. These Dirac or Breit equations, free of the structural singularities which plague the usual Breit equation, can then be used safely under all circumstances, encom- passing numerous applications in the fields of particle, nuclear, and atomic physics which involve highly relativistic and strong binding configurations. 2 I. INTRODUCTION In contrast to the accepted description [?·p+m+V]? = 0 (1.1) of the relativistic quantum mechanics of a single spin-one-half particle moving in an exter- nal potential V given by Dirac, a number of different approaches have been used for two interacting spin-one-half particles. A traditional one based on the Breit equation [1], also known as the Kemmer-Fermi-Yang equation [2], [?1 ·p1 +?1m1 +?2 ·p2 +?2m2 +V(r12)]? = E?, (1.2) contains a sum of single-particle Hamiltonians and an interaction term between them. (E is the total energy in an arbitrary frame.) Although the Breit equation is not manifestly covariant, it has provided good perturbative descriptions of the positronium and muonium energy levels. However, it is well known that those parts of the Breit interaction V(r) = ??r (1? 12?1 ·?2 ? 12?1 · ˆr?2 · ˆr), (1.3) in the Breit equation beyond the Coulomb term should not be treated nonperturbatively, but must be handled only perturbatively. In other words, a consistent treatment of the Breit equation in powers of ? will generate unwanted terms not present in quantum electrody- namics [Refs. 3,4]. A more serious difficulty of the Breit equation is that when the interactions are treated nonperturbatively, structural pole singularities could appear at finite r even when the in- teractions themselves are singularity-free there [5,8]. Two of us have found recently that these pole singularities occur under certain conditions depending on well-defined algebraic relations among the different potentials that could appear [6,7]. They lead to unphysical states or unphysical resonances and therefore must be strictly avoided [5,8]. The primary purpose of this paper is to show how these pole singularities can be avoided from the beginning so that the Breit equation can be used without difficulty in diverse 3 applications in particle, nuclear, and atomic physics involving highly relativistic motions and strong binding potentials. This is accomplished by relating this older approach to one that has been developed much more recently. Dirac’s constraint Hamiltonian dynamics [9] provides a framework for an approach pro- posed by Crater and Van Alstine [10,11] that differs notably from that of the Breit equation. It gives two-body coupled Dirac equations, each of which has an “external potential” form similar to the one-body Dirac equation in that for four-vector and scalar interactions one has S1? ??51[?1 ·(p1 ? ˜A1) +m1 + ˜S1]? = 0, (1.4a) S2? ??52[?2 ·(p2 ? ˜A2) +m2 + ˜S2]? = 0, (1.4b) (?5i, i = 1,2 are the ?5 matrices for the constituent particles). Unlike the Breit approach, these equations are manifestly covariant and have interactions introduced by minimal sub- stitution. They have common solutions if the operators S1,S2 commute. This situation, called strong compatibility [9], can be achieved by the proper choice of the operators ˜Ai and ˜Si [10,11]. The commutator cannot, however, be made to vanish for more general types of interactions such as pseudoscalar or pseudovector. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances the commutator can be reduced to a combination of S1 and S2 themselves. The equations are then said to be weakly compatible [9], because this will also ensure that solutions of S1? = 0 in the more general cases could be solutions of S2? = 0 as well. These compatibility properties are important because they guarantee the existence of common solutions to (i.e. the consistency of) the constraint equations before they are actually solved. Although the constraint two-body (CTB) Dirac equations have been used far less fre- quently than the Breit equation, they have important advantages over the latter. In de- scribing electromagnetic bound states [11,12] they yield nonperturbative and perturbative results in agreement with each other. That is, the exact (or numerical) solution produces 4 a spectrum that agrees through order ?4 with that given by perturbative treatment of the Darwin, spin-orbit, spin-spin, and tensor terms obtained from the Pauli reduction. In par- ticular, total c.m. energies w for the e+e? system in the 1JJ states is found to satisfy a Sommerfeld formula [11,12] w = m radicaltpradicalvertex radicalvertexradicalbt2+ 2slashbiggparenleftbigg1 + ?2 n+ radicalBig (J + 12)2 ??2 ?J ? 12)2 parenrightbigg = 2m? m? 2 4n2 ? m?4 2n3(2J + 1) + 11 64 m?4 n4 +O(? 6). (1.5) They agree through order ?4 with those of the perturbative solution of the same equation, and also with those of standard approaches to QED. A recent paper has numerically extended this agreement at least to the n = 1,2,3 levels for all allowable J and unequal masses [12]. In this paper, we are concerned with another advantage of the CTB Dirac equations, namely that no unphysical states and resonances of the type discussed in [6,7] have ever appeared in past applications. We are able to show here that this is in fact true for a general interaction and that this is a consequence of the exponential structure of the interactions appearing in them. This result is obtained by first reducing the CTB Dirac equations to a Breit equation and an equation describing an orthogonality constraint. The equivalent Breit equation is then shown to be singularity-free, provided that the exponential interaction structure is not destroyed by inadvertent approximations and that the operators appearing in the exponent are themselves free of finite r singularities. The exponential structure that tames the unphysical singularities turns out to be a consequence of a relativistic “third law” describing the full recoil effects between the two interacting particles. We carefully trace, in the formulation of the CTB Dirac equations, how this structure arises from the need to make these equations at least weakly compatible. Compared to the laissez-aller approach of the Breit equation for which any interaction seems possible, the restriction of the interaction structure needed in the constraint approach represents a conceptual advance in the problem. For this reason, we take pain to elucidate its conceptual foundation as we present elements of the CTB Dirac equations needed for our 5

Van Assche1 1 Ecole Polytechnique, CP 165, Universit e Libre de Bruxelles, 1050 Brussels, Belgium 2 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA July 2001 Abstract. The cloning of quantum variables with continuous spectra is investigated. We de ne a Gaussian 1-to-2 cloning machine, which copies equally well two conjugate variables such as position and momentum or the two quadrature components of a light mode. The resulting cloning  delity for coherent states, namely F = 2=3, is shown to be optimal. An asymmetric version of this Gaussian cloner is then used to assess the security of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution scheme that allows two remote parties to share a Gaussian key. The information versus disturbance tradeo underlying this continuous quantum cryptographic scheme is then analyzed for the optimal individual attack. Methods to convert the resulting Gaussian keys into secret key bits are also studied. The extension of the Gaussian cloner to optimal N-to- M continuous cloners is then discussed, and it is shown how to implement these cloners for light modes, using a phase-insensitive optical ampli er and beam splitters. Finally, a phase-conjugated inputs (N;N0)- to-(M;M0) continuous cloner is de ned, yielding M clones and M0 anticlones from N replicas of a coherent state and N0 replicas of its phase-conjugate (with M0 M = N0 N). This novel kind of cloners is shown to outperform the standard N-to-M cloners in some situations.

Recently, however, it has been discovered that several concepts that were invented for qubits extend very naturally to the domain of continuous variables (e.g., posi- tion and momentum of a particle, or the quadrature com- ponents of a mode of the electromagnetic  eld). The  rst result in this direction concerned quantum teleportation [24,7], and gave rise to a lot of interest in continuous- variable quantum information processing. In the present paper, we focus on the notions of quantum cloning and quantum key distribution, and investigate how they can be extended to continuous variables. Cloning machines (that achieve the optimal approxi- mate cloning transformation compatible with the so-called no-cloning theorem) have been a fundamental research topic in the last  ve years. In Section 2, we will de ne a Gaussian cloner, which achieves the optimal cloning of a continuous variable compatible with the requirement of being covariant with respect to displacements and rota- tions in phase space. In other words, this cloner dupli- cates all coherent states with a same  delity (F = 2=3). ? Submitted to the special issue of the European Physical Journal D on \Quantum interference and cryptographic keys: novel physics and advancing technologies". Proceedings of the conference QUICK 2001, Cargese, Corsica, April 7{13, 2001. The optical implementation of this cloner and its exten- sion to N-to-M cloners are also discussed. In Section 3, we then turn to quantum key distribution, and propose a continuous-variable cryptosystem that allows two remote parties to share a Gaussian key by exchanging continuous key elements carried by squeezed states. This scheme is the proper continuous counterpart of the protocol BB84 [2] for qubits. Our continuous cryptosystem is related to the Gaussian cloner for an asymmetric version of the lat- ter achieves the optimal individual eavesdropping strat- egy. Thus, our previous results on continuous cloning can be used to analyze the information versus disturbance tradeo , in order to assess the security of this continu- ous cryptosystem. We  nd that the information gained by the eavesdropper is exactly upper bounded by the infor- mation lost by the authorized receiver. We also investigate a protocol to convert the raw Gaussian keys into a string of secret key bits, that is, we show how to apply recon- ciliation and privacy ampli cation on continuous key el- ements. Finally, in Section 4, we come back to the issue of cloning continuous variables, and de ne a new class of \phase-conjugated inputs" cloners. These cloners produce several clones (and anticlones) from several replicas of an input coherent state and its phase conjugate. We show that adding these extra phase-conjugated inputs makes it possible to improve the cloning (and anticloning)  delity with respect to the standard N-to-M cloners. 2 N. J. Cerf et al.: Cloning and Cryptography with Quantum Continuous Variables 2 Quantum Cloning Machines Let us  rst seek for a transformation which duplicates with a same  delity all coherent states j i, with  = (x+ip)=p2. The fundamental requirement we put on this transformation is that it is covariant with respect to dis- placements in phase space. That is, if two input states are identical up to a displacement ^D(x;p) = e ix^peip^x, then their respective copies should be identical up to the same displacement. (In this paper, we put  h = 1). Thus, de- noting by H the Hilbert space corresponding to a single copy, cloning can be de ned as a completely positive trace- preserving linear map C :H!H 2 :j ih j!C(j ih j) such that C( ^D(x;p)j ih j^Dy(x;p)) = ^D 2(x;p)C(j ih j) ^Dy 2(x;p); (1) for all displacements ^D(x;p) in the phase space. A sim- ple way to meet displacement covariance is to seek for a cloning transformation whose output clone individual states are given each by a Gaussian mixture:  (j ih j) = 12  2 Z dxdpe x 2+p2 2 2  ^D(x;p)j ih j^Dy(x;p); (2) where  2 is the cloning-induced error variance. In the fol- lowing we will refer to such a transformation as a Gaussian cloner. Note that Eq. (2) is such that the cloning induced noise on the quadratures ^x or ^p is invariant under rota- tions in the phase space, which is certainly a desirable property since it is satis ed by coherent states. Consider the following unitary operator: ^U1;2;3 = e i(^x3 ^x2)^p1e i^x1(^p2+^p3)e i^x2 ^p3; (3) where modes 1, 2 and 3 refer respectively to the origi- nal, the additional copy, and an auxiliary mode (also ref- ered to as an ancilla). This operator can be used to build a Gaussian cloner if the additional copy and the ancilla are initially prepared in the vacuum state[12]. Indeed, it is readily checked that this transformation outputs two clones whose individual states are Gaussian-distributed, as in Eq.(2), with a variance  2 = 1=2. In particular, it copies all coherent states j i with the same  delity f1;2 =h j ( )j i= 2=3. This machine is optimal in the sense that it is im- possible to have  2(1;2) < 1=2. To prove this, let us con- sider the following situation. A coherent state is processed through such a cloner, the observable ^x being measured at one output clone while the observable ^p is measured at the other output. Let us denote by  2x and  2p the respective error variances corresponding to this joint measurement. From the general theory on the simultaneous measurement of conjugate observables [1], we know that  2x 2p  1: (4) BS Ancilla Pump Vacuum Linear Ampli (G=2)                a1 a3 a’3 aout a’2 a2 a’1 Fig. 1. Implementation of a 1 ! 2 cloner using a phase- insensitive linear ampli er and a 50 : 50 beam-splitter (BS). Using Eq. (2), we get ( ^x2 + 2)( ^p2 +  2) 1; (5) where  ^x2( ^p2) is the intrinsic variance of ^x (^p) of the input state and  2 is the cloning-induced variance. Now, using the uncertainty principle  ^x2 ^p2  1=4 and the in- equality a2 + b2  2pa2b2, we conclude that  2  1=2, implying that the unitary operator Eq. (3) is indeed opti- mal to achieve Gaussian cloning[10]. A possible implementation of this machine (see Fig. 1) consists in processing the input mode into a linear phase- insensitive ampli er [8] of gain G = 2: ^aout =p2^a1 + ^ay3; ^a03 = ^ay1 +p2^a3; (6) with aj = ( ^xj +i^pj)=p2 denoting the annihilation opera- tor for mode j). Then, one produces the two output clones by processing the output signal of the ampli er through a 50 : 50 phase-free beam-splitter: ^a01 = 1p 2(^a1 + ^a2); ^a02 = 1p 2(^a1 ^a2); (7) It is readily checked that this scheme leads to an equal x-error and p-error variance of 1=2 for both clones, that is, it achieves the optimal Gaussian cloner. We will now present two generalizations of this 1!2 Gaussian quantum cloning machine. The  rst one consists in a transformation which from N ( 1) original input states produces M ( 2) output copies whose individual states are again given by an expression similar to Eq.(2), but with a di erent error variance  2N;M. Using an argu- ment based on the concatenation of cloners, it is possible to derive a lower bound on  2N;M, that is[10]  2N;M  1N  1M; (8) with the corresponding  delity for coherent states fN;M  MNMN + M N: (9) Again, these bounds can be attained by a transformation whose implementation necessitates only a phase-insensitive N. J. Cerf et al.: Cloning and Cryptography with Quantum Continuous Variables 3 linear ampli er and beam splitters [6]. Loosely speaking, the procedure consists in concentrating the N input modes into a single mode by a network of beam splitters, to amplify the resulting mode, and then to distribute the output ampli ed mode into M output modes through a second network of beam-splitters. Note that the bounds Eq. (8,9) can also be derived using techniques similar to the ones used for evaluating quantum nondemolition mea- surements. This was been done in a paper establishing a link between cloning and teleportation for continuous vari- ables [19]. The second generalization of the 1!2 Gaussian quan- tum cloning machine we will brie y consider here is the case where the ^xand ^pquadratures are not treated equally, and the case where the two output clones do not have the same  delity. Equation (2) then has to be replaced by  (j ih j) = 1 2  q  2i;x 2i;p Z dxdpe ( x2 2 2i;x+ p2 2 2i;p)  ^D(x;p)j ih j^Dy(x;p); (10) where  2i;x (resp.  2i;p) stands for the cloning-induced error variance in the quadrature ^x (resp. ^p) for the ith clone. In this case, it is possible to prove [12] that the following cloning uncertainty relations must hold:  21;x 22;p 1=4;  21;p 22;x 1=4: (11) Asymmetries between the output clones and between the x/p variables can be characterized by the following two parameters:  =  1;x  2;x =  1;p  2;p ; and  =  1;x  1;p =  2;x  2;p : (12) As suggested in [16], asymmetric machines (with  6= 1) can be implemented by a scheme akin to Fig. 1 in the sense that only two beam splitters and a single linear am- pli er are needed. We will see in the following section how these asymmetric quantum cloning machines can be used to assess the security of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol. 3 Quantum Key Distribution In this section, we introduce a quantum protocol for the distribution of Gaussian key elements, which is a continuous- variable analogue of the protocol BB84 [2] { we assume here that the reader is familiar with BB84. Our protocol, introduced in [13], works like BB84 but with binary in- formation being replaced by continuous information that behaves essentially like in a Gaussian channel. One exploits a pair of canonically conjugate continuous variables x and p, which can be thought of, for instance, as the two quadratures X1 andX2 of the amplitude of a mode of the electromagnetic  eld [22]. Alice randomly chooses a random key element r that follows a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance  2, and randomly decides to encode it into either x (i.e.,hxi= r) or p (i.e.,hpi= r). An eavesdropper ignoring which of these two encoding rules is used cannot acquire information without disturbing the state. Let us now describe the exact nature of the states used for encoding each key element. When encoding the value r  N(0; x) in x, Alice creates a Gaussian state such that hxi = r, hpi = 0,  x2 =  2x and thus  p2 = 1=4 2x. Similarly, when the value r N(0; p) is encoded in p, the encoding state has hpi = r, hxi = 0,  p2 =  2p and thus  x2 = 1=4 2p. On his side, Bob measures either x or p at random. Like in BB84, half of the measurements give results that are uncorrelated to Alice’s values, so half of the samples must be discarded when Alice discloses the encoding vari- able. Unlike BB84, however, measuring the correct vari- able does not yield the exact value of r, even with a perfect apparatus, because of the intrinsic noise of the Gaussian state. The value r follows a Gaussian distribu- tion N(0; x;p), to which some Gaussian noise is added N(0; x;p), thus resulting in a Gaussian distribution with variance  2x;p +  2x;p. We can therefore model the trans- mission of r as a Gaussian channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) equal to  2x= 2x or  2p= 2p. An important requirement of the protocol is to make it impossible for Eve to be able to infer which encoding variable Alice used. For this, measuring the correct or in- correct variable (x or p) must yield statistically indistin- guishable results. If, in contrast, Eve was able to detect (even not perfectly) that she measured the wrong set, then she could fake an attenuation by discarding wrong key elements and retransmitting only the correctly mea- sured ones. This indistinguishability requirement can be expressed as the equality of the density matrices resulting from the two encoding rules, or equivalently as [13] 1 +   2x  2x = 1 +  2p  2p = 1 4 2x 2p: (13) A proof of this is given in Appendix A. This also means that the SNR is the same for both variables x and p, and that the information rate is [15] I = 12 log2(1 +  2x= 2x) = log2(2 x p): (14) 3.1 Eavesdropping by cloning Let us now discuss an individual eavesdropping of this protocol with cloning machines such as those de ned in Section 2. Eve makes two clones of the state sent by Al- ice, one of which is transmitted to Bob, and the other is measured in the correct variable when Alice reveals the encoding rule. This happens to be the optimal individual eavesdropping strategy as shown in [13] and [21]. We use a 1 ! 2 cloning machine, and we keep the freedom to make a better clone for Bob or Eve (parameter 4 N. J. Cerf et al.: Cloning and Cryptography with Quantum Continuous Variables  ) and to get more accuracy in x or p (parameter  ). The subscripts 1 and 2 for the two copies are replaced respectively by B and E for the two recipients. The added variances on the clones will be:  2B;x = 12  ;  2B;p = 12   1; (15)  2E;x = 12  1 ; 2E;p = 12  1  1: (16) Let us calculate the resulting information rates. When Bob measures x, the result is a ected both by the intrinsic  uctuations of x and by the noise induced by the cloning operation, thus resulting in a total variance  2x+ 12  . This is the noise power in the Gaussian channel representing the communication between Alice and Bob through Eve’s cloning machine. Therefore, the information rate is now IB;x = 12 log2(1 +   2x  2x + 12  ): (17) Similarly, one can calculate the new variance on p mea- sured by Eve on her clone, namely  2p + 12  1  1. This gives an information rate IE;p = 12 log2(1 +   2p  2p + 12  1  1 ): (18) Adding the last two information rates indicates the balance between Bob’s and Eve’s information. Remark- ably, the information that Eve gains by using this attack on p is exactly equal to the information that Bob loses on x [13], IB;x +IE;p = 12 log2(1 +   2x  2x ) = I: (19) Of course, this balance also works when swapping x and p, namely IB;p +IE;x = I. This result is interesting because it allows Bob to bound from above the information gained by a possible eaves- dropper. Assuming symmetry of the protocol in x and p, Bob can estimate I IB and is guaranteed thatIE  I IB (in practice, a part of the information loss will be due to channel noise). From Ref. [20], it is kwown that with rec- onciliation and privacy ampli cation carried out over a public authenticated channel, one is guaranteed to gener- ate key bits whenever IB > IE. This last condition is in turn guaranteed provided that IB >I=2, so that up to a 50% information loss on Bob’s side is acceptable in order to generate key bits. 3.2 From Gaussian key elements to secret bits Let us now investigate the classical part of the key distri- bution protocol since we have to deal with reconciliation and privacy ampli cation based on continuous raw key elements here, in contrast to BB84. Shannon’s formula gives us an upper limit on the number of bits one can send through a Gaussian channel with a given SNR. In our protocol, neither Alice nor Bob chooses the Gaussian random values. Yet, we want them to be able to extract a common string of bits out of their correlated Gaussian values, revealing as little information as possible on the public channel. Our secret key distillation procedure [25] works in the following way. First, Alice and Bob are going to extract common bits out of their Gaussian-distributed values, us- ing a binary correction algorithm such as Cascade or a variant [5,23,26,14]. They will use it several times, on several real-to-binary conversion functions. Then, the re- sulting bits will undergo the usual privacy ampli cation procedure [20,4,3], for instance using a universal class of hash functions. Let X denote the random variable representing Alice’s Gaussian values, and X0 Bob’s values. Alice uses a set of real-to-binary conversion functions Si(X) = 0;1, (1 i  m). These are called slices, in the sense that instead of per- forming reconciliation on the real-valued string x1:::l, we operate on each string Si(x1:::l) sequentially, like slices of the main, real-valued string. On his side, Bob uses another set of functions ~Si, called slice estimators, which re ects his best guess on the bit Si(X) given his current knowl- edge. The slice estimator ~Si is not only a function of X0 but also of the previous slices, ~Si(X0;S1(X);:::;Si 1(X)). This results from the fact that the slices are corrected sequentially for i = 1;:::;m, and thus upon correcting slice i Bob already knows S1(X);:::Si 1(X). By care- fully choosing the functions Si and ~Si, both parties can extract a common string of bits out of the correlated Gaussian values, while only disclosing a little more than H(S1(X);:::;Sm(X)jX0) bits on the public channel. A more detailed analysis is given in [25]. Let us take an example. Assume the channel has 2= 2 = 15, which means that Alice and Bob can share up to I = 12 log2(1 +  2= 2) = 2 bits per raw key element. We assume m = 5 slices as a trade-o between the e ciency of large m and the use of reasonable computing resources. The slice functions Si(X), 1  i 5 are constructed in the following way. First, the Gaussian distribution of X is divided into 2m = 32 intervals. The interval labeling function T(X), which associates an interval number (from 0 to 31) to each value of x, is chosen so as to maximize I(T(X);X0). Thus, Bob starts with an optimal knowledge of T(X). Then, we create the slice functions by assigning bit values to each of these intervals. Stated otherwise, we create a bijection between S1:::5(X) and T(X) so that each vector of the 5 slice bits represents one (and only one) in- terval de ned by T(X). Much freedom is permitted at this step, but what we found to work best is to assign the least signi cant bit of the interval number to S1(X), the second bit to S2(X), and so on up to the most signi cant bit to S5(X). The slice estimator functions ~S1:::5(X0;:::) are con- structed from the slices S1:::5(X) and from the joint prob- ability density fX;X0(x;x0). Each estimator ~Si evaluates whether Si(X) = 0 or Si(X) = 1 is more likely condition- ally on the arguments given to the estimator, namely X0 and the previous slices Sj<i(X). N. J. Cerf et al.: Cloning and Cryptography with Quantum Continuous Variables 5 In the present example, Alice’s and Bob’s bits are al- most uncorrelated when correcting slices 1 and 2. The bi- nary correction algorithm does not have to be used at this point { it is enough for Alice to entirely reveal S1(X) and S2(X) for the whole string. Then, slice 3 on Alice’s side and the slice estimator 3 on Bob’s side produce two bit strings that match 76% of the time { it is thus possible to proceed with error correction using a binary correction al- gorithm. Note that the bit strings would be less correlated if the knowledge of S1(X) and S2(X) was not brought to Bob. Then for slice 4 (resp. slice 5), Alice’s and Bob’s string match 98% (resp. 99.999%) of the time, for which the binary correction will disclose only a small amount of information. Again, the knowledge of slices 1-3 helped Bob accurately estimate slice 4, which in turn helped him estimate slice 5. As a result of this 5-step correction, Alice and Bob share a string of bits whose entropy is H(S1:::5) = 4:8 bits per raw key element. Assuming a perfect binary correction algorithm, about 3 bits per raw key elements were dis- closed. Roughly speaking, the net e ect is thus 4:8 3 = 1:8 bit of secret information per raw key element after privacy ampli cation (which is to be compared with the 2 bits per key element as given by Shannon’s formula). This is of course only an example. More elaborate con- structions can be performed, such as gathering d Gaussian key elements at once. In fact, it was shown in [25] that the disclosed information reaches the Shannon bound as d!1, just like for instance data compression works best for asymptotically large block sizes. Now that we showed how quantum cryptography (fol- lowed by reconciliation and privacy ampli cation) can work with continuous variables, let us investigate another appli- cation of continuous variables to a special kind of quantum cloning machines. 4 Phase-Conjugated Inputs Quantum Cloning Machines It has been shown that an antiparallel pair of qubits is in- trinsically more informative than a pair of parallel qubits if the goal is to encode a direction in space [18]. Simi- larly for quantum continuous variables, one can show that more information can be encoded in a pair of phase- con- jugated coherent statesj ij  ithan in two identical repli- cas j ij i [9]. Following on these ideas, we present here a phase-conjugated input (PCI) quantum cloning machine, that is, a transformation which taking as input N replicas of a coherent statej iand N0 replicas of its complex con- jugatej  i, produces M optimal clones ofj i[11]. Again we will require that all the clones are treated equally, and that the cloner is covariant with respect to both displace- ments and rotations in phase space. As a matter of fact, it turns out that such a transformation can be implemented optimally using a sequence of beam-splitters, a single non- linear medium, and another sequence of beam-splitters, just as in the case of standard cloning. The procedure is the following (see Fig. 2): (i) Concentrate the N replicas of j i stored in the N modesfclg(l = 0:::N 1) into a single mode a1, resulting in a coherent state of amplitudepN . This operation can be performed with a network of beam-splitters achieving a N-mode Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)[6]. We get: a1 = 1pN N 1X l=0 cl; (20) and N 1 vacuum modes. Similarly, with aN0-mode DFT, concentrate the N0 replicas ofj  istored in the N0 modes fdlg (l = 0:::N0 1) into a single mode a2. This results in a coherent state of amplitude pN0  . We have: a2 = 1pN N0 1X l=0 dl: (21) (ii) Apply the following transformation on the modes a1 and a2, resulting in modes b1 and b2 de ned by b1 =pGa1 +pG 1ay2; b2 =pG 1ay1 +pGa2; (22) where pG = pN0M0 pNM N0 N ; (23) with M0 M = N0 N: (24) For obvious reasons, we call this transformation a ’phase- conjugated input ampli cation’ (PCIA). (iii) Distribute the output mode b1 into M clones fc0lg (l = 0:::M 1) with a M-mode DFT: c0l = 1pM(b1 + ei kl=Mvk); (25) where fvkg (k = 1:::M 1) denote M 1 additional vacuum modes. It is readily veri ed that this procedure yields M clones of j i. Interestingly, the amplitude b2 of the other output of the PCIA has a mean value pM0  . Therefore, it can be used to produce M0 phase-conjugated clones (or anti-clones) ofj i,fd0lg(l = 0:::M0 1), using a M0-mode DFT: d0l = 1pM0(b2 +ei kl=M0wk) (26) where fwkg (k = 1:::M0 1) denote M0 1 additional vacuum modes. Some algebra shows that this procedure is optimal to produce M clones, and that the additional M0 anti-clones are also optimal[11]. Furthermore, since the step (ii) of our procedure is linear and phase-insensitive, the resulting PCI cloner is covariant with respect to translations and rotations of the state to be copied: all coherent states are

The path to resolving this para- dox may well be the path to a consistent uni ed theory of matter and quantized gravity. In classical gravity, a black hole is a classical solution of the equations of mo- tion such that there is a region of spacetime that is causally disconnected from asymptotic in nity (see e.g. Reference [1]). The boundary of such a region is called the event horizon. Consider a large collection of low-density matter, in an asymptotically  at spacetime. For simplicity, we take the starting con guration to be spherically symmetric and nonrotating (these restrictions do not a ect the nature of the paradox that emerges). This ball of matter will collapse toward smaller radii under its self-gravitation. At some point, the matter will pass through a critical radius, the Schwarzschild radius Rs, after which its further collapse cannot be halted, whatever the equation of state. The  nal result, in classical general relativity, is that the matter ends up in an in nite-density singular point, while the metric settles down to the Schwarzschild form ds2 = (1 2GNMrc2 )dt2 + (1 2GNMrc2 ) 1dr2 + r2d 2: (1) Here GN is Newton’s constant of gravity, and c is the speed of light. The horizon radius of this hole is Rs = 2GNMc2 !2M; (2) where the last expression arises after we set GN = 1, c = 1. (In what follows, we adopt these units unless otherwise explicitly indicated; we also set  h = 1.) 2 D-Branes and Black Holes 3 Classically, nothing can emerge from inside the horizon to the outside. A test mass m has e ective energy zero if it is placed at the horizon; it has rest energy mc2, but a negative gravitational potential energy exactly balances this positive contribution. For a rough estimate of the horizon size, we may put this negative energy to be the Newtonian value  GNMm=r, for which Rs GNM=c2. It may appear from the above that the gravitational  elds at the horizon of a black hole are very large. This is not true. For a neutral black hole of mass M, the magnitude of the curvature invariants, which are the measure of local gravitational forces, is given by jRj GNMr3 : (3) Thus, at the horizon r = rH = 2GNM, the curvature scales as 1=M2. As a result, for black holes with masses M  G 1=2N , the curvatures are very small and the spacetime is locally rather close to  at spacetime. In fact, an object falling into a black hole will not experience any strong force as it crosses the horizon. However, an asymptotic observer watching this object will see that it takes an in nite time to reach the horizon. This is because there is an in nite gravitational red-shift between the horizon and the asymptotic region. An important point about black hole formation is that one does not need to crush matter to high densities to form a black hole. In fact, if the hole has mass M, the order of magnitude of the density required of the matter is   MR3 s  1M2: (4) Thus, a black hole of the kind believed to exist at the center of our galaxy (108 solar masses) could form from a ball with the density of water. In fact, given any density we choose, we can make a black hole if we take a su cient total mass with that density. This fact makes it very hard to imagine a theory in which black holes do not form at all because of some feature of the interaction between the matter particles. As a consequence, if black holes lead to a paradox, it is hard to bypass the paradox by doing away with black holes in the theory. It is now fairly widely believed that black holes exist in nature. Solar-mass black holes can be endpoints of stellar evolution, and supermassive black holes ( 105  109 solar masses) probably exist at the centers of galaxies. In some situations, these holes accrete matter from their surroundings, and the collisions among these infalling particles create very powerful sources of radiation that are believed to be the source of the high-energy output of quasars. In this arti- cle, however, we are not concerned with any of these astrophysical issues. We concentrate instead on the quantum properties of isolated black holes, with a view toward understanding the problems that arise as issues of principle when quantum mechanical ideas are put in the context of black holes. For example, the Hawking radiation process discussed below is a quantum pro- cess that is much weaker than the radiation from the infalling matter mentioned above, and it would be almost impossible to measure even by itself. (The one possible exception is the Hawking radiation at the last stage of quantum evapora- tion. This radiation emerges in a sharp burst with a universal pro le, and there are experiments under way to look for such radiation from very small primordial black holes.) 4 Das & Mathur 1.1 The Entropy Problem Already, at this stage, one  nds what may be called the entropy problem. One of the most time-honored laws in physics has been the second law of thermody- namics, which states that the entropy of matter in the Universe cannot decrease. But with a black hole present in the Universe, one can imagine the following process. A box containing some gas, which has a certain entropy, is dropped into a large black hole. The metric of the black hole then soon settles down to the Schwarzschild form above, though with a larger value for M, the black hole mass. The entropy of the gas has vanished from view, so that if we only count the entropy that we can explicitly see, then the second law of thermodynamics has been violated! This violation of the second law can be avoided if one associates an entropy to the black hole itself. Starting with the work of Bekenstein [2], we now know that if we associate an entropy SBH = AH4G N (5) with the black hole of horizon area AH, then in any Gedanken experiment in which we try to lose entropy down the hole, the increase in the black hole’s attributed entropy is such that d dt(Smatter + SBH) 0 (for an analysis of such Gedanken experiments, see e.g. [3]). Furthermore, an \area theorem" in general relativity states that in any classical process, the total area of all black holes cannot decrease. This statement is rather reminiscent of the statement of the second law of thermodynamics|the entropy of the entire Universe can never decrease. Thus the proposal (Equation 5) would appear to be a nice one, but now we encounter the following problem. We would also like to believe on general grounds that thermodynamics can be understood in terms of statistical mechanics; in particular, the entropy S of any system is given by S = log  ; (6) where  denotes the number of states of the system for a given value of the macroscopic parameters. For a black hole of one solar mass, this implies that there should be 101078 states! But the metric (Equation 1) of the hole suggests a unique state for the geometry of the con guration. If one tries to consider small  uctuations around this metric, or adds in, say, a scalar  eld in the vicinity of the horizon, then the extra  elds soon  ow o to in nity or fall into the hole, and the metric again settles down to the form of Equation 1. If the black hole has a unique state, then the entropy should be ln 1 = 0, which is not what we expected from Equation 5. The idea that the black hole con gura- tion is uniquely determined by its mass (and any other conserved charges) arose from studies of many simple examples of the matter  elds. This idea of unique- ness was encoded in the statement \black holes have no hair." (This statement is not strictly true when more general matter  elds are considered.) It is a very interesting and precise requirement on the theory of quantum gravity plus matter that there be indeed just the number (Equation 5) of microstates corresponding to a given classical geometry of a black hole. D-Branes and Black Holes 5 1.2 Hawking Radiation If black holes have an entropy SBH and an energy equal to the mass M, then if thermodynamics were to be valid, we would expect them to have a temperature given by TdS = dE = dM: (7) For a neutral black hole in four spacetime dimensions, AH = 4 (2GNM)2, which gives T = ( dSdM) 1 = 18 G NM : (8) Again assuming thermodynamical behavior, the above statement implies that if the hole can absorb photons at a given wave number k with absorption cross section  (k), then it must also radiate at the same wave number at the rate  (k) =  (k) e hjkjkT  1 ddk (2 )d: (9) In other words, the emission rate is given by the absorption cross section multi- plied by a standard thermal factor (this factor would have a plus sign in place of the minus sign if we were considering fermion emission) and a phase space factor that counts the number of states in the wave number range ~k and ~k + d~k. (d denotes the number of spatial dimensions.) Classically, nothing can come out of the black hole horizon, so it is tempting to say that no such radiation is possible. However, in 1974, Hawking [4] found that if the quantum behavior of matter  elds is considered, such radiation is possible. The vacuum for the matter  elds has  uctuations, so that pairs of particles and antiparticles are produced and annihilated continuously. In normal spacetimes, the pair annihilates quickly in a time set by the uncertainty principle. However, in a black hole background, one member of this pair can fall into the hole, where it has a net negative energy, while the other member of the pair can escape to in nity as real positive energy radiation [4]. The pro le of this radiation is found to be thermal, with a temperature given by Equation 8. Although we have so far discussed the simplest black holes, there are black hole solutions that carry charge and angular momentum. We can also consider generalizations of general relativity to arbitrary numbers of spacetime dimensions (as will be required below) and further consider other matter  elds in the theory. It is remarkable that the above discussed thermodynamic properties of black holes seem to be universal. The leading term in the entropy is in fact given by Equation 5 for all black holes of all kinds in any number of dimensions. Further- more, the temperature is given in terms of another geometric quantity called the surface gravity at the horizon,  , which is the acceleration felt by a static object at the horizon as measured from the asymptotic region. The precise relation|also universal|is T =  2 : (10) 1.3 The Information Problem \Hawking radiation" is produced from the quantum  uctuations of the matter vacuum, in the presence of the gravitational  eld of the hole.

Our starting point is highly warped IIB compactifications with nontrivial NS and RR three-form fluxes. By incorporating known corrections to the superpotential from Euclidean D-brane instantons or gaugino condensation, one can make models with all moduli fixed, yielding a supersymmetric AdS vacuum. Inclusion of a small number of D3 branes in the resulting warped geometry allows one to uplift the AdS minimum and make it a metastable de Sitter ground state. The lifetime of our metastable de Sitter vacua is much greater than the cosmological timescale of 1010 years. We also prove, under certain conditions, that the lifetime of dS space in string theory will always be shorter than the recurrence time.

INTRODUCTION There has recently been a great deal of interest in find- ing de Sitter (dS) vacua of supergravity and string the- ory. This is motivated in part by the desire to construct possible models for late-time cosmology (since a small positive cosmological constant seems to be required by recent data [1]), and in part by more conceptual wor- ries that arise in the study of dS quantum gravity (as discussed, for instance, in [2]). The no-go theorem of [3] guarantees that such solutions cannot be obtained in stringor M-theoryby usingonly the lowestorderterms in the 10d or 11d supergravity action, but one expects that corrections to the leading order Lagrangian in the gs or ?prime expansion or inclusion of extended sources (branes) should improve the situation. Indeed, a careful discus- sion of how such additional sources (which are present in string theory) invalidate the no-go theorem for warped backgrounds and allow one to find highly warped com- pactifications appears in [4]. Additional sources which violate the assumptions of the theorem were shown to yield dS vacua in noncritical string theory in [5]. Here, we use our knowledge of quantum corrections and extended objects in string theory to argue that there are dS solutions of ordinary critical string theory. Our basic strategy is to first freeze all the moduli present in the compactification, while preserving supersymmetry. We then add extra effects that break supersymmetry in a controlled way and lift the minimum of the potential to a positive value, yielding dS space. To illustrate the construction we work in the specific context of IIB string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau (CY) manifold in the presence of flux. As described in [4] such construc- tions allow one to fix the complex structure moduli, but not the K¨ahler moduli of the compactification. In par- ticular, to leading order in ?prime and gs, the Lagrangian possesses a no-scale structure which does not fix the over- all volume (we shall assume that this is the only K¨ahler modulus in the rest of this note; it is of course possible to construct explicit models which have this property). In order to achieve the first step of fixing all moduli, we therefore need to consider corrections which violate the no-scale structure. Here we focus on quantum non- perturbative corrections to the superpotential which are calculable and show that these can lead to supersymme- try preserving AdS vacua in which the volume modulus is fixed in a controlled manner. Having frozen all moduli we then introduce supersym- metry breaking by adding a few D3 branes in the com- pactification; this is a compactified version of the situa- tion discussed in [6]. The addition ofD3 branes does not introduce additional moduli: their worldvolume scalars are frozen by a potential generated by the background fluxes [6]. Inclusion of anti-D3 branes in the absence of other corrections yields a run-away to infinite volume of the compact space (since the energy density in the D3 branes generates a tadpole for the volume modulus). However, we show that in the presence of the quantum corrections we have described, in a sufficiently warped background the D3 tension can be a small enough cor- rection to lift the formerly AdS vacuum to positive cos- mological constant, without destabilizing the minimum. The extent of supersymmetry breaking and also the re- sulting cosmological constant of the dS minimum can be varied in our construction, within a range, in two ways. One may vary the number of D3 branes which are in- troduced in the above manner, and one can also vary the warping in the compactification (by tuning the num- ber of flux quanta through various cycles). It is impor- tant to note that this corresponds to a freedom to tune 2 discrete parameters, so while fine-tuning is possible, one should not expect to be able to tune to arbitrarily high precision. Since there is still a vacuum at very large ra- dius with approximately zero energy (this is the Dine- Seiberg runaway vacuum [7]), any dS minimum is only a false vacuum; but it is only destabilized by tunneling effects, and we argue that the lifetimes one can achieve are extremely long. In addition, we argue that under the assumption that the potential between the dS mini- mum and the Dine-Seiberg vacuum at infinity is positive (which will be true in any simple examples, since a single dS maximum is the only intervening critical point), the lifetime of the dS minimum is always shorter than the timescale for Poincar´e recurrences discussed in [8]. While our emphasis in this paper is on dS vacua it is worth remarking that the first step of our construc- tion, which freezes all moduli, is of interest in its own right (for another recent approach to this problem, see [9]; other recent ideas about fixing the volume modulus, while leaving other moduli unfixed, appear in [10] and references therein). In fact moduli stabilization has been an important open question in string theory and related phenomenology. We show that this can be achieved by putting together a few different effects, all of which are quite well understood by now. Preserving susy allows us to carry out this analysis with control. Once all moduli are frozen, susy breaking effects other than the introduc- tion of D3 branes alone can also be considered. Some of these, like the D3/D7 inflationary models of [11], or models with both branes and anti-branes [12], are also of possible cosmological interest. A more complete discussion of the possible cosmologi- cal toy models that one can construct using combinations of the ingredients described in this paper, in the spirit of [13], will appear in [14]. We should note that there has been a great deal of interesting work on constructing dS solutions in super- gravity and string theory. dS minima of 4d gauged super- gravities which do not as yet have a known string theory embedding appeared in [15, 16], while dS compactifica- tions of gauged 6d supergravity appear in [17]. The work of [5] constructs dS vacua in supercritical string theory using many of the same ingredients which arise here. Fi- nally, the importance of using fluxes in the cosmological context was stressed in [18], where however the problem of moduli stabilization was left as a black box (related ideas appeared in [19]). Cosmology of the simplest flux compactifications, on the T6/Z2 orientifold [20, 21, 22] (whose gauged supergravity description is worked out in [23]), was recently investigated in [24]. II. FLUX COMPACTIFICATIONS OF IIB STRING THEORY, INCLUDING CORRECTIONS In this section, we briefly describe the required knowl- edge of flux compactifications of type IIB string theory. In section IIA we describe the models of [4], and in section IIB we enumerate various quantum corrections which can modify the superpotential and K¨ahler poten- tial used in [4]. In section IIC, we show that incorporat- ing the generic corrections can yield (supersymmetric) AdS minima with all moduli stabilized. A. Calabi-Yau orientifolds with flux We start with F-theory [25] compactified on an elliptic CY fourfold X. The F-theory fourfold is a useful way of encoding the data of a solution of type IIB string theory; the base manifold M of the fibration encodes the IIB geometry, while the variation of the complex structure ? of the elliptic fiber describes the profile of the IIB axio- dilaton. In such a model, one has a tadpole condition ?(X) 24 = ND3 + 1 2?210T3 integraldisplay M H3 ?F3 . (1) Here T3 is the tension of a D3 brane, ND3 is the net number of (D3?D3) branes one has inserted filling the noncompact dimensions, and H3, F3 are the three-form fluxes in the IIB theory which arise in the NS and RR sector, respectively. As shown by Sen [26], in the absence of flux, it is always possible to deform such an F-theory model to a locus in moduli space where it can be thought of as an orientifold of a IIB Calabi-Yau compactification. For this reason, we will use the language of IIB orien- tifolds, with M being the Calabi-Yau threefold which is orientifolded. In this language, the term ?(X)24 counts the negative D3-brane charge coming from theO3 planes and the induced D3 charge on D7 branes, while the terms on the right-hand side count the net D3 charge from trans- verse branes and fluxes in the CY manifold. As in [4], we will assume we are working with a model having only one K¨ahler modulus, so h1,1(M) = 1 (h1,1(X) = 2, and one modulus is frozen in taking the F-theory limit, where one shrinks the elliptic fiber). Such models can be explicitly constructed, by e.g. using the examples of CY fourfolds in [27] or by explicitly constructing orientifolds of known CY threefolds with h1,1 = 1. In the presence of the nonzero fluxes, one generates a superpotential for the Calabi-Yau moduli, which follows from [28] (see also [29, 30]) and is of the form W = integraldisplay M G3 ?? (2) where G3 = F3??H3, with ? the IIB axiodilaton. Com- bining this with the tree-level K¨ahler potential K = ?3ln[?i(?? ¯?)]?ln[?i(??¯?)]?ln[?i integraldisplay M ???] (3) where?is the single volume modulus (? =b/?2+ie4u??; our conventions are as in [4]), and using the standard 3 N = 1 supergravity formula for the potential, one finds V = eK ? ?summationdisplay a,b ga¯bDaWDbW ?3|W|2 ? ?? eK( summationdisplay i,j gi¯jDiWDjW) (4) Here, a,b runs over all moduli fields, while i,j runs over all moduli fields except ?; and we see that because ? does not appear in (2), it cancels out of the potential energy (4), leaving the positive semi-definite potential characteristic of no-scale models [31]. One should use this potential as follows. Fix an in- tegral choice of H3,F3 in H3(M,Z); then, the potential (4) fixes the moduli at values where the resulting G3 is imaginary self-dual (ISD). Supersymmetric solutions furthermore require G3 to be type (2,1) (more generally, G3 would have a (0,3) piece). Thus in supersymmetric solutions W = 0 on the vacuum, while in the nonsuper- symmetric solutions, W = W0, a constant which is de- termined by the (0,3) piece of G3. In generic solutions, the complex structure moduli of the F-theory fourfold (in IIB language, the complex structure moduli, the dilaton, and the moduli of D7 branes) are completely fixed, leav- ing only the volume modulus ?. The scale of the masses m for the moduli which are fixed is m? ? prime R3 (5) where R is the radius of the manifold (Im? scales like R4). In this approximation,R is unfixed. By tuning flux quanta, it is possible (at least in some cases) to fix gs at small values, though not arbitrarily small. There is one last point we will need to use in sec- tion III. The fluxes (and any transverse branes) serve as sources for a warp factor. Therefore, such models with branes and flux are generically warped compacti- fications. In fact, as shown in [4], following earlier work of [20, 32, 33, 34, 35], it is possible to construct mod- els with exponentially large warping. One can write the Einstein frame metric of the compactification as ds210 = e2A(y)?µ?dxµdx? +e?2A(y)˜gmn(y)dymdyn (6) with y coordinatizing the compact dimensions, and ˜gmn the unwarped metric on M (so in the orientifold limit, it is a Calabi-Yau metric). Then it is shown in [4] (by compactifying the Klebanov-Strassler solution [36]) that one can construct models parametrized by flux integers M,K such that eAmin ? exp[?(2piK)/(3gsM)] (7) with eA being of order one at generic points. This means in particular that with reasonably small flux quanta, one can generate exponentially large ratios of scales in such models. In the following, we will assume that gs and the com- plex structure moduli have been fixed at the scale (5) by a suitable choice of flux, and concentrate on an ef- fective field theory for the volume modulus ?. This is self-consistent, in that the final mass for ? will be small compared to (5). One last comment. Light states could also arise from modes living in the throat region which experiences large warping. We assume here that any such excitations are gapped, as in [36]. Then typically the ? modulus, which has a Planck scale suppressed mass, will be much lighter than these excitations and we can neglect them as well in the low energy theory. B. Corrections to the no-scale models Here, we write down two known sources of corrections to the no-scale models, both parametrize possible correc- tions to the superpotential (2). Then, in section IIC, we show that including either correction to the superpoten- tial yields supersymmetric models with AdS vacua. 1) Witten has argued that in type IIB compactifica- tions of this type, there can be corrections to the super- potential coming from Euclidean D3 branes [37]. This happens when the fourfoldX used for F-theory compact- ification admits divisors of arithmetic genus one, which project to four-cycles in the base M. In the presence of such instantons, there is a correction to the superpoten- tial which at large volume yields a new term Winst = T(zi)exp(2pii?) (8) where T(zi) is a complex structure dependent one-loop determinant, and the leading exponential dependence comes from the action of a Euclidean D3 brane wrap- ping a four-cycle in M. Since the zi and the dilaton are fixed by the fluxes at a scale (5), we can integrate them out and view (8) as simply providing a superpotential for the volume modulus. 2) In general models of this sort, one finds (at special loci in the complex structure moduli space) non-Abelian gaugegroupsarisingfrom geometric singularitiesinX, or in type IIB language, from stacks of D7 branes wrapping 4-cycles in M. Assume that the fluxes have fixed one at a point in moduli space where this phenomenon occurs (examples appear in [38], for instance). Consider a stack of Nc coincident branes. The 4d gauge coupling of the SU(Nc) Yang-Mills theory on such wrapped branes (we ignore the decoupled U(1) factor) satisfies 8pi2 g2YM = 2pi R4 gs = 2piIm? . (9) Since the complex structure moduli of X are completely fixed, the D7 brane moduli (at least in cases where the 4-cycle being wrapped has vanishing h1, which are easy to arrange) are also fixed. Therefore, any charged mat- ter fields (which would create a Higgs branch for the D7 gaugetheory) have alsobeen givena mass at a high-scale; 4 and the low-energy theory is pure N = 1 supersymmet- ric SU(Nc) gauge theory. This theory undergoes gluino condensation, which results in a nonperturbative super- potential Wgauge = ?3Nc = Ae2pii?Nc (10) where ?Nc is the dynamical scale of the gauge theory, and the coefficient A is determined by the energy scale below which the the SQCD theory is valid (There are also threshold corrections in general, these contribute sub- leading effects.) We see that this leads to an exponential superpotential for ? similar to the one above (but with a fractional multiple of ? in the exponent, since the gaug- ino condensate looks like a fractional instanton effect in W). So effects 1) and 2) have rather similar consequences for our analysis; we will simply assume that there is an exponential superpotential for ? at large volume. In our companion paper [14], we investigate some interest- ing possibilities for cosmology if there are multiple non- Abelian gauge factors. Using the fourfolds in [27], it is easy to construct examples (with h1,1(X) = 2) which could yield gauge groups of total rank up to ? 30. The results of [39] suggest that much larger ranks should be possible. One important comment is in order before we proceed. Besides corrections to the superpotential of the kind dis- cussed above, there are also corrections to the K¨ahler potential (see e.g. [40] for a calculation of some lead- ing corrections). In our analysis we will ensure that the volume modulus is stabilized at values which are para- metrically large compared to the string scale. This makes our neglect of K¨ahler corrections self consistent. C. Supersymmetric AdS Vacua Here, we show that the corrections to the superpoten- tial considered above can stabilize the volume modulus, leading to a susy preserving AdS minimum. We perform an analysis of the vacuum structure just keeping the tree- level K¨ahler potential K = ?3ln[?i(???)] (11) and a superpotential W = W0 +Aeia? . (12) W0 is a tree level contribution which arises from the fluxes. The exponential term arises from either of the two sources above, and the coefficient a can be deter- mined accordingly. In keeping with the fact that the complex structure moduli and the dilaton have received a mass (5), we have set them equal to their VEVs and con- sider only the low-energy theory of the volume modulus. To avoid the need to worry about additional open-string moduli, we assume the tadpole condition (1) has been solved by turning on only flux, i.e. with no additional D3 branes. At a supersymmetric vacuum D?W = 0. We simplify things by setting the axion in the ? modulus to zero, and letting ? = i?. In addition we take A,a and W0 to be all real and W0 negative. The minimum then lies at DW = 0 ? W0 = ?Ae?a?cr(1+ 23 a?cr) (13) The potential, V = eK parenleftbigG??D?WD?W ?3|W|2parenrightbig, at the minimum is negative and equal to VAdS = (?3eKW2)AdS = ?a 2A2e?2a?cr 6?cr (14) We see that we have stabilized the volume modulus while preserving supersymmetry. It is important to note that the AdS minimum is quite generic. Any corrections to the K¨ahler potential will still result in a susy minimum which solves (13). A few comments are in order before we proceed. A controlled calculation requires that ? greatermuch 1, this ensures that the supergravity approximation is valid and the ?prime corrections to the K¨ahler potential are under control. It also requires that a? > 1 so that the contribution to the superpotential from a single (fractional) instanton is reliable. Generically, if the fluxes break supersymmetry, W0 ?O(1), and these conditions will not be met. How- ever it is reasonable to expect that by tuning fluxes one can arrange so that W0 lessmuch 1. In these circumstances we see from (13) that a? > 1. Taking a < 1, one can then ensure that ?greatermuch 1, as required. As an illustrative example we consider W0 = ?10?4, A= 1, a = 0.1. This results in a minimum at ?cr ? 113. 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0.5 V ? FIG. 1: Potential (multiplied by 1015) for the case of expo- nential superpotential with W0 = ?10?4, A = 1, a = 0.1. There is an AdS minimum. Another possibility to get a minimum at large vol- ume is to consider a situation where the fluxes preserve susy, and the superpotential involves multiple exponen- tial terms, i.e. “racetrackpotentials” for the stabilization of? [41]. Such a superpotential could arise from multiple stacks of seven branes wrapping four cycles which cannot 5 be deformed into each other in a susy preserving manner [14]. In this case by tuning the ranks of the gauge groups appropriately one can obtain a parametrically large value of ? at the minimum. Finally it is plausible that in some cases, there could be some other moduli which have not yet been fixed in this approximation (if, for instance, the fluxes were non- generic and left some of the complex structure moduli of the Calabi-Yau manifold unfixed). Since the dilaton is already fixed by fluxes and the radial modulus is fixed due to non-perturbative exponential terms in the super- potential, one might find interesting and realistic cosmol- ogy driven by these other scalar fields from the compact- ified string theory. Here, however, we will neglect this possibility, and focus instead on another mechanism for uplifting the AdS vacuum to a dS vacuum. III. CONSTRUCTING DS VACUA In this section, we uplift the supersymmetric AdS vacua of section IIC to yield dS vacua of string theory. In section IIIA, we describe the new ingredient: D3 branes transverse to M. In section IIIB, we show that for rea- sonable choices of parameters, the inclusion ofD3 branes yields dS vacua. A. D3 branes in ISD fluxes In the tadpole condition (1), there is a contribution from both localized D3 branes and from fluxes. To find AdS vacua with no moduli in the previous section, we assumed that the condition was saturated by turning on fluxes in the compact manifold. Now, we assume that in fact we turn on too much flux, so that (1) can only be satisfied by introducing one D3 brane. In the flux background determining a solution of the sort described in section II, the D3 does not have translational moduli; they are fixed by the ISD fluxes, which generate a poten- tial for the worldvolume scalars. This kind of situation was studied in [6]. Now, the tadpole is cancelled, but there is an extra bit of energy density from the “extra” flux and D3 brane. In fact, as in equation (73) of [6], one finds that the D3 brane adds an additional energy: ?V = 2a 40T3 g4s 1 (Im?)3 (15) with a0 the warp factor at the location of the D3 brane. As described in [6], in the presence of ISD fluxes of the sort characterizing the Klebanov-Strassler throat, any anti-D3 branes are driven to the end of the throat, where the warp factor is minimized. It follows from (7) that the value of a0 is exponentially small, and hence in suit- able models the inclusion of a D3 adds to the potential an exponentially suppressed term. The prefactor of 2 in (15) arises because the ambient five-form flux adds a re- pulsive energy equal to the tension for an D3 brane, see [42] (above equation (3.9)). Note also that we are con- sidering solutions which meet the ISD condition, even in the presence of the additional flux required to insert the D3 brane. There are corrections to (15) but these are quadratic in the number of D3 that are added and are small. The important point is that due to the warping the addition of the D3 brane breaks supersymmetry by a very small amount. In general terms, we get a term in the potential which goes like ?V = 8D(Im?)3 (16) (the factor of 8 is added for later convenience). The coef- ficientD depends on the number ofD3 branes and on the warp factor at the end of the throat. These parameters can be altered by discretely changing the total flux, and the fluxes which enter in (7), respectively. This allows us to vary the coefficientDand the susy breaking in the sys- tem, while still keeping them small (More properly, since the flux can only be discretely tuned, D can be varied but not with arbitrary precision). We will see that by tuning the choice of D one can perturb the AdS vacua of IIC to produce dS vacua with a tunable cosmologicalcon- stant. The vacua will clearly only be metastable, since all of the sources of energy we have introduced vanish as Im???. B. Uplifting AdS vacua to dS vacua We now add to the potential a term of the form D/?3, as explained above. For suitable choices of D, the AdS minimum will become a dS minimum, but the rest of the potential does not change too much. There is one new important feature, however: there is a dS maximum separating the dS minimum from the vanishing potential at infinity. The potential is: V = aAe ?a? 2?2 parenleftbigg1 3?aAe ?a? +W0 +Ae?a? parenrightbigg + D?3 By fine-tuning D, it is easy to have the dS minimum very close to zero. For the modelW0 = ?10?4,A = 1,a = 0.1 D = 3×10?9 we find the potential (multiplied by 1015): Note, if one does not require the minimum to be so close to zero, D does not have to be fine-tuned so pre- cisely. A dS minimum is obtained as long asD lies within a range, eventually disappearing for large enough D. If one does fine tune to get the minimum very close to zero, the resulting potentials are quite steep around the dS minimum. In this circumstance, the new term ba- sically uplifts the potential without changing the shape too much around the minimum, so the ? field acquires a surprisingly large mass (relative to the final value of the cosmological constant).

Dieser an sich selbstverständliche Sachverhalt gerät leicht in Vergessenheit, und es mag zur Verringerung der oft beklagten Kluft zwischen den beiden Kulturen, der geisteswissenschaftlich-künstlerischen und der technisch-naturwissenschaftlichen, beitragen, wenn man ihn wieder ins Gedächtnis zurückruft. Das vorliegende Buch handelt von der Entwicklung der Atomphysik in den letzten 50 Jahren, so wie der Verfasser sie erlebt hat. Naturwissenschaft beruht auf Experimenten, sie gelangt zu ihren Ergebnissen durch die Gespräche der in ihr Tätigen, die miteinander über die Deutung der Experimente beraten. Solche Gespräche bilden den Hauptinhalt des Buches. An ihnen soll deutlich gemacht werden, daß Wissenschaft im Gespräch entsteht. Dabei versteht es sich von selbst, daß Gespräche nach mehreren Jahrzehnten nicht mehr wörtlich wie dergegeben werden können. Nur Briefstellen sind, wo sie zitiert werden, im Wortlaut angeführt. Es soll sich auch nicht eigentlich um Lebenserinnerungen handeln. Daher hat der Verfasser sich erlaubt, immer wieder zusammenzuziehen, zu straffen und auf historische Genauigkeit zu verzichten; nur in den wesentlichen Zügen sollte das Bild korrekt sein. In den Gesprächen spielt die Atomphysik keineswegs immer die wichtigste Rolle. Vielmehr geht es ebensooft um menschliche, philosophische oder politische Probleme, und der Verfasser hofft, daß gerade daran deutlich wird, wie wenig sich die Naturwissenschaft von diesen allgemeineren Fragen trennen läßt. Viele der beteiligten Personen sind im Text mit dem Vornamen eingeführt; teils weil sie später nicht weiter an die Öffentlichkeit getreten sind, teils weil die Beziehung des Verfassers zu ihnen durch die Verwendung des Vornamens besser dargestellt wird. Auch läßt sich so leichter der Eindruck vermeiden, als handle es sich um eine historisch in allen Einzelheiten getreue Wiedergabe der verschiedenen Begebenheiten. Aus diesem Grund wurde auch darauf verzichtet, ein genaueres Bild dieser Persönlichkeiten zu zeichnen; sie werden gewissermaßen nur an der Art, wie sie sprechen, erkennbar. Großer Wert wurde jedoch gelegt auf die korrekte und lebendige Schilderung der Atmosphäre, in der die Gespräche stattgefunden haben. Denn in ihr wird der Entstehungsprozeß der Wissenschaft deutlich, an ihr kann am besten verstanden werden, wie das Zusammenwirken sehr verschiedener Menschen schließlich zu wissenschaftlichen Ergebnissen von großer Tragweite führen kann. Es war die Absicht des Verfassers, auch dem der modernen Atomphysik Fernstehenden einen Eindruck von den Denkbewegungen zu vermitteln, die die Entstehungsgeschichte dieser Wissenschaft begleitet haben. Dabei mußte in Kauf genommen werden, daß im Hintergrund der Gespräche manchmal sehr abstrakte und schwierige mathematische Zusammenhänge sichtbar werden, die nicht ohne ein eingehendes Studium verstanden werden können. Endlich hat der Verfasser mit der Aufzeichnung der Gespräche noch ein weiteres Ziel verfolgt. Die moderne Atomphysik hat grundlegende philosophische, ethische und politische Probleme neu zur Diskussion gestellt, und an dieser Diskussion sollte ein möglichst großer Kreis von Menschen teilnehmen. Vielleicht kann das vorliegende Buch auch dazu beitragen, die Grundlage dafür zu schaffen. 
Fisica FS-0210 Física General I: Desarrollo histórico de la mecánica clásica 160 UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS ESCUELA DE FISICA FS-210 FISICA GENERAL I DESARROLLO HISTORICO DE LA MECANICA CLASICA      La Revolución Científica, asociada al desarrollo de la mecánica clásica, es uno de los grandes acontecimientos que definen al mundo moderno: comienza con la publicación de la obra de Copérnico y culmina con la obra de Newton, pasando por las aportaciones, entre otros, de Galileo y Kepler. Tal acontecimiento no sólo conduce al mundo de los objetos, sino que se convierte para el espíritu en un medio para llevar a cabo su propio conocimiento (nacimiento de la filosofía moderna).  Con ella se quiebra la imagen del mundo antiguo y medieval: el espacio y el tiempo se ensanchan hasta el infinito. Y la razón es lo único que nos permite entrar en ese ámbito, la que lo asegura, la que le pone medidas y límites no en lo físico, sino en lo legal. En la nueva imagen del universo confluyen tanto el ímpetu por lo singular y concreto, lo fáctico; como el deseo de lo universal. La observación sensible tiene que aliarse con la medición exacta y de ambas surgir la nueva teoría natural.       Galileo y Kepler concibieron la idea de ley natural en toda su amplitud y profundidad, pero solo pudieron aplicarla en fenómenos naturales aislados. Faltaba por mostrar que la legalidad rigurosa que regía en las partes podía extenderse a la totalidad y que el universo, en cuanto tal, era accesible a la comprensión exacta del conocimiento matemático y adecuadamente abarcable por él. La obra de Newton aporta esta prueba. Esto explica la veneración de la que gozó Newton en el pensamiento ilustrado de la época. “La naturaleza y sus leyes yacían ocultas en la noche; Dios dijo: Que Newton sea, y todo se hizo luz” [De unos versos de Alexander Pope (1688-1744)]. Época a la que D´Alambert caracteriza como la de la Filosofía. Con él se creía haber llegado a encontrar, por fín tierra firme, haber encontrado un fundamento que ya no podría ser conmovido por ningún cambio en el conocimiento de la naturaleza.        Por primera vez se traza una historia física del mundo al margen del dogmatismo y la autoridad religiosa, y que sólo quiere apoyarse en los hechos observables y en los principios universales del conocimiento teórico de la naturaleza. De este modo se abre una brecha definitiva en el sistema tradicional, y el espíritu afanoso y crítico de Voltaire no descansará hasta que no haya demolido piedra a piedra todo este sistema. Este trabajo de demolición era imprescindible si se quería llevar a cabo la reconstrucción de la física. La Ilustración logra esta victoria culminando con ello el proceso que se iniciara en el FS-0210 Física General I: Desarrollo histórico de la mecánica clásica 161 Renacimiento, y entregó al conocimiento racional un dominio fijo, dentro del cual ya no existía obstáculo alguno ni ninguna coacción autoritaria, sino que, por el contrario, podía moverse libremente en todas las direcciones y, en virtud de esa libertad, llegar a la conciencia plena de sí mismo y de las fuerzas que residían en él.     Nicolás Copérnico (1473-1543)      Astrónomo polaco -nacido en Torún-, creador de la teoría heliocéntrica  Estudia en la universidad de Cracovia y viaja a Italia, donde estudia en las universidades de  Bolonia, Padua y Ferrara. De vuelta a su patria pasa a ser secretario y médico personal de su tío . Las líneas fundamentales de su teoría heliocéntrica y  el resumen o esbozo lo expresa en su libro “Breve comentario de Nicolás Copérnico sobre sus propias hipótesis acerca de los movimientos celestes” que no contiene ninguna clase de demostración matemática.       Entre 1512 y 1528 Copérnico lleva a cabo algunas observaciones astronómicas y madura definitivamente el sistema heliocéntrico esbozado en el “Commentariolus”; redacción de sus ideas definitivas sobre el sistema del mundo y de no demasiadas observaciones astronómicas. Pese a su excesiva prudencia, sus ideas eran de alguna manera conocidas.             En 1539, un matemático luterano, Georg Joachim von Lauchen, llega a Frauenburg, deseoso de conocer las ideas de Copérnico; la estancia, que debía ser de unas semanas, se prolonga por espacio de dos años: primero estudia el sistema copernicano y luego, con la ayuda de un antiguo amigo de Copérnico, Tiedemann Giese, logra convencer a Copérnico de la conveniencia de publicar un resumen del manuscrito que guardaba celosamente. Copérnico accede a las peticiones de Rheticus y Giese y acepta publicar el manuscrito, que llevará por nombre “Sobre los giros de los orbes celestes”. Andreas Osiander escribe el prefacio anónimo al libro “De revolutionibus”, en el que declara que el libro trata sólo de puras hipótesis matemáticas, cuya finalidad no es otra que el cálculo.       Es propio del astrónomo calcular la historia de los movimientos celestes con una labor diligente y diestra. Y además concebir y configurar las causas de estos movimientos, o sus hipótesis, cuando por medio de ningún proceso racional puede averiguar las verdaderas causas de ellos. Y con tales supuestos pueden calcularse correctamente dichos FS-0210 Física General I: Desarrollo histórico de la mecánica clásica 162 movimientos a partir de los principios de la geometría, tanto mirando hacia el futuro como hacia el pasado. Ambas cosas ha establecido el autor de modo muy notable. Y no es necesario que estas hipótesis sean verdaderas, ni siquiera que sean verosímiles, sino que basta con que muestren un cálculo coincidente con las observaciones, [...] Y no espere nadie, en lo que respecta a las hipótesis, algo cierto de la astronomía, pues no puede proporcionarlo; para que no salga de esta disciplina más estúpido de lo que entró, si toma como verdad lo imaginado para otro uso. Andreas Osiander. Al lector sobre las hipótesis de esta obra, en N. Copérnico, Sobre las revoluciones, Tecnos, Madrid 1987, página 4.       El “De revolutionibus orbium coelestium” lo publica en Nuremberg el famoso librero Petreius, coincidiendo con la fecha de la muerte de Copérnico. La obra es la descripción del denominado sistema copernicano, o teoría heliocéntrica del universo, que da comienzo a lo que se llamará posteriormente revolución copernicana, con las demostraciones matemáticas necesarias para su justificación. El cambio astronómico radical que propone la teoría heliocéntrica de Copérnico consiste en situar al Sol en el centro del universo, en el lugar que ocupaba antes la Tierra, y situar a ésta en el lugar que antes ocupaba aquél, y hacer girar en torno al Sol todos los planetas, incluida la Tierra, considerada ahora como un planeta más -el tercero en la distancia desde el Sol- y ya no como el centro inmóvil del universo, tal como toda la cosmología aristotélica y ptolemaica, a excepción de Aristarco de Samos, había supuesto.       La Tierra se movía; y, según Copérnico, con pluralidad de movimientos: según el movimiento anual, hacia el oeste, girando alrededor del Sol, como todos los planetas; este movimiento explica tanto el movimiento aparente del Sol hacia el este como los movimientos aparentes (directos, hacia el este, y retrógrados, hacia el oeste) de los planetas. Según el movimiento de rotación diaria, hacia el este, lo que explica el movimiento aparente del Sol durante el día hacia el oeste, la alternancia del día y la noche, la diversidad de estaciones, y el movimiento aparente nocturno del cielo estrellado.  Y por último, según el movimiento cónico y anual del eje de rotación, llamado de declinación, hacia el oeste en su extremo norte, la Tierra gira alrededor de su propio eje como una (lenta) peonza o trompo; el efecto de este movimiento sería mantener el eje de rotación de la Tierra siempre en la misma dirección.       Con los movimientos de la Tierra explica Copérnico todos los movimientos celestes. En particular, las dos grandes irregularidades de los planetas, que desde antiguo habían constituido el problema que la astronomía debía explicar: el movimiento retrógrado de los planetas y su período de revolución. El sistema copernicano explicaba estos dos movimientos sin tener que recurrir a los epiciclos, o grandes círculos imaginados en que se movían los planetas ni, por supuesto, a los ecuantes ptolemaicos.       No siendo mucho mejor, desde el punto de vista matemático y astronómico, el sistema copernicano que el ptolemaico, el copernicano gozó pronto de gran aceptación: se impusieron la gran simplicidad y la armonía que atribuía al nuevo modelo astronómico de universo. La teoría pasará a convertirse en el centro de todas las polémicas científicas y teológicas, será prohibida por la Iglesia, la causa de la condena de Bruno y Galileo y uno de los mayores fracasos de la política científica y cultural de la iglesia católica.  FS-0210 Física General I: Desarrollo histórico de la mecánica clásica 163    Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)      Matemático, físico, astrónomo y filósofo italiano, nacido en Pisa. El principal iniciador de la revolución científica y de la ciencia moderna. Estudió y enseñó matemáticas en aquella ciudad; redacta su primer escrito sobre el movimiento de los cuerpos, “De motu”, de contenido aristotélico, aunque crítico y bajo la influencia de la física de Arquímedes. Por esta época inicia investigaciones experimentales y observa el comportamiento de cuerpos en caída libre; la tradición dirá que observó la caída de objetos desde la torre inclinada de Pisa y posteriormente en la de Padua. Pasa al servicio directo de Cosme II de Medici, gran duque de Florencia.       En 1597, en sendas cartas a Jacopo Mazzoni y a Kepler, se declara copernicano convencido. La noticia de la aparición de una estrella «nova», el 9 de octubre de 1604, señala el comienzo de su interés por la astronomía. Sus opiniones son criticadas por Cesare Cremonini y Ludovico delle Colombe, que comentan la aparición de «nova» en sentido aristotélico. En 1609 le llegan noticias sobre la existencia del telescopio. Se construye uno, con el que examina el cielo en busca de pruebas contra la astronomía aristotélica. Observa la existencia de montañas en la Luna, multitud de estrellas invisibles a simple vista, los planetas medíceos (lunas de Júpiter) y, más adelante, la apariencia tricorpórea de Saturno, la presencia de manchas solares y las fases de Venus. La observación de los astros medíceos representa la primera defensa pública de la teoría de Copérnico. Los resultados expuestos y publicados en “Sidereus Nuncius” (1610) levantan duras reacciones en contra por parte de filósofos aristotélicos y astrónomos, que ridiculizan las observaciones como ilusiones ópticas o engaños. Kepler, la excepción, muestra entusiasmo por los descubrimientos y los cree verdaderos; y así se lo hace saber a Galileo. Su oposición al aristotelismo se convierte en un conflicto entre la ciencia y la fe. Cuando Galileo llega a Roma el 1 de abril de 1611, es recibido con honores por el papa Pablo V, es nombrado miembro de la Academia de Lincei y los jesuitas astrónomos y matemáticos del Colegio Romano celebran su llegada. El cardenal Bellarmino pide informes a Christopher Clavius sobre la fidelidad de las observaciones. El cardenal Maffeo Barberini alaba públicamente a Galileo (más adelante, como Urbano VIII papa, será su peor adversario). Galileo cuenta, además, con algún que otro discípulo directo o amigo, como Benedetto Castelli y Piero FS-0210 Física General I: Desarrollo histórico de la mecánica clásica 164 Dini. Algunos liberales, como Cremonini se oponen a las experiencias y observaciones de Galileo, sólo por fidelidad a sus principios de siempre. Frente a Galileo hay, no obstante, un ejército de aristotélicos, de no demasiada categoría, cerriles y dogmáticos, dispuestos a lanzarle encima la Santa Inquisición a la mínima sospecha de herejía.       En diversas cartas , entre ellas la que va dirigida a Cristina de Lorena, expresa, como declaración de principios, que las Sagradas Escrituras solo tienen competencia en los asuntos que son de fe («ex fide»); para el resto de cosas, que la «experiencia sensible» o las «demostraciones necesarias» hacen evidente o verdadero, no debe acudirse a ellas. A la Escritura le importa precisar y enseñar cómo se va al cielo, no cómo va el cielo. El conjunto de aquellas reciben el nombre de “Cartas copernicanas”, y representa el primer conflicto entre heliocentrismo y religión. Galileo está reclamando la libertad de pensamiento intelectual y la autonomía de la ciencia respecto de la fe. Su programa intelectual choca de frente con las autoridades eclesiásticas. Galileo es condenado por la Inquisición. El 24 de febrero de 1616, una comisión del Santo Oficio descalifica la afirmación de que el Sol sea el centro del mundo y esté quieto y que la Tierra no sea el centro del mundo y se mueva, y el 5 de marzo de 1616 la Congregación del Santo Oficio la declara «falsa doctrina» y contraria a la Sagrada Escritura. El papa ordena al cardenal Bellarmino que advierta a Galileo que abandone sus puntos de vista copernicanos (26 de febrero de 1616). El silencio de Galileo dura hasta 1623, año en el que publica “El ensayador” que dedica al nuevo papa, y mantiene con él sucesivas y amistosas entrevistas. La única finalidad del libro era desprestigiar el sistema de Tycho-Brahe, defendido y difundido por los jesuitas del Colegio Romano. En él, aparte de una desastrosa hipótesis sobre los cometas, se halla la profesión de fe de Galileo en la ciencia moderna y la descripción de sus características: aquella que sabe leer el libro de la naturaleza escrito en lenguaje matemático. Por esta misma época Galileo empieza a trabajar en el “Diálogo”, aconsejado por el mismo papa Urbano VIII que le reclama que exponga sus ideas cosmológicas por escrito, observando el decreto de 1616. El libro lo termina en 1630 pero no aparece, tras diversos problemas de censura e imprenta, hasta el 21 de febrero de 1632, en Florencia. De sus tres personajes, Simplicio y Salviati, defienden respectivamente el sistema aristotélico y el copernicano, mientras que Sagredo, es la persona de buen juicio que media entre uno y otro. La argumentación a favor del sistema copernicano, que enfrenta al ptolemaico, debe hacerla Galileo ex suppositione, esto es, como si se tratara de una simple hipótesis matemática de los movimientos planetarios.       El libro provoca, dado su contenido en el que la teoría copérnicana aparece como la más razonable y verosímil, aparte de otras razones, su juicio y condena: el castigo implica la abjuración de la teoría heliocéntrica , la prohibición del “Diálogo”, la privación de libertad y algunas penitencias de tipo religioso . Durante los años siguientes, Galileo arrestado domiciliariamente, enfermo y casi ciego, reune todos sus apuntes sobre mecánica, en los que había trabajado durante veinte años. El resultado son las “Consideraciones y demostraciones matemáticas sobre dos nuevas ciencias”, publicadas en 1638. La gran aportación de Galileo en esta obra está en la tercera y cuarta jornadas, de las cuatro en que la divide, donde se refiere a las leyes del movimiento uniforme y acelerado y al movimiento de los proyectiles, respectivamente. Es su gran obra científica. Sus aportaciones a la historia del pensamiento se pueden agrupar en tres apartados: 1. En la 
Fisica arXiv:hep-th/0110027 v1   2 Oct 2001 BRX TH-500 A Century of Gravity: 1901{2000 (plus some 2001) S. Deser1 Department of Physics, Brandeis University Waltham, MA 02454, USA This lecture consists of two parts. The  rst is a (totally unsystematic) survey of some of the high points in the evolution of gravity and its successors, primarily in the course of the past century. The second summarizes some new work on surprising properties of higher (> 1) spin  elds in cosmological backgrounds: the presence of  gives rise to discrete sets of massive models endowed with gauge invariances, that divide the (m2; ) plane into unitary and non-unitary phases. The unitary region common to fermions and bosons shrinks to  at space ( ! 0) as their spins increase. 1 Introduction The scope implicit in this Conference’s title seemed to mandate a suitably sweeping topic. My initial choice, \1002, the Sequel", would permit daring extrapolations from the present without risk of contradiction. I quickly realized, however, that it would also require truly long-term vision; the other permutation, 2100, being too close, I will instead go modestly backwards, and try to retrodict some of the high points, especially of the past century, in the development of gravitational physics. Indeed, this period has seen an amazing progression, bringing the subject from a prolonged stasis to the center (for good or ill) of almost all fundamental research since the standard model, leaping (at least initially) over the desert between GeV and Planck scales. Most of you will know most of this history, and will have your own emphasis and judgements; nevertheless it may be useful to think back to some of our smart (if ignorant) predecessors. In order to keep the historical account as neutral as possible (and partly from laziness), I will provide no references and mention no living names (you know who you are!). Not being a historian, however, I will balance the talk with the usual stu of lectures { new, 2001, physics { even if it means a considerable descent from the heroic deeds of yore. So the second, orthogonal, part of my talk will give a brief (referenced) account of current work, in collaboration with Andrew Waldron, on the gravity/particle theory interface, namely the properties of \partially massless" (the quotes are deserved) higher spin  elds in cosmological backgrounds { deSitter (dS) or anti-deSitter (AdS). The new results here are quite surprising when compared with our usual Minkowski background concepts: There is partial massless- ness and gauge invariance at tuned values of m26 = 0, a phase plane with coordinates (m2; ) divided by these gauge lines into unitarily allowed and forbidden regions. The region of 1Invited Lecture at 2001: A Spacetime Odyssey, Ann Arbor, May 2001 1 common boson/fermion unitarity puts bounds on, or even forbids a cosmological constant! In presenting this research, I also hope to satisfy those who are history-averse: they can skip directly to it. 2 On Whose Shoulders? As I launch into the past, I reemphasize that I have not tried to be historically accurate, instead attempting to remember what seems most seminal as one looks back over the past three centuries (in almost as few pages!). For this reason, I begin with a particularly im- pressionistic sketch of the prehistory, i.e., the origins of modern gravitational theory. The immediate answer to all questions is of course \Newton", and so it should be. But we must give their due to the ancient observers, particularly the Arabs, Chinese and Greeks, the mechanicians of the Middle Ages and the geometers/arithmeticians who helped bring mathematics to a stage su ciently useful to physics. It was fortunate that our solar system su ced as an arena, since it was both easily and secularly observable and received enough of society’s support (not always for disinterested reasons) to provide enough data. The great predecessors nearest to Newton (both as observers and theoreticians) include Brahe, Copernicus, Descartes, Galileo (who also performed notable terrestial experiments) and Kepler. I would add amongst the theoreticians, R mer, that ancestor of special relativity, who put c on the map, unwittingly undermining Newtonian gravity at its birth and adding his third to our triad of fundamental units. In Newton’s own shadow we must (at least) include Halley, Hooke and Leibnitz. We should also remember the vast development, stimulated by the Newtonian scheme, of mechanics and mathematics by Bessel, Euler, Laplace, Lagrange, Poisson and indeed most of the greats of the 18th and early 19th century. Their elaboration of its rami cations, such as perturbation theory, and the many-body problem were to be invaluable (as we have all learned) throughout physics, even unto the birth of quantum mechanics. This fruitful interplay between mathematics and physics (so marvelled at by Wigner) has always been present: The Gauss-Riemann constellation is its mid-19th century culmination, presaging (and making possible) the geometrization of physics in a very direct way. Hilbert, Poincar e, Weyl and their living successors have continued the tradition. But enough ancient history; I’m supposed to cover the 20th century! 3 The Heroic Era: 1901{1950 Let’s, rather arbitrarily, separate the beginnings of the new gravity from its modern and postmodern avatars. Most conveniently for our chronology, the obvious symbol for this division is the Planck length, conceived, providentially, at the start of my survey. [Planck’s Note, in the Berliner Berichte, introduced it almost as an aside.] The next few years belonged of course to special relativity, when c became a conversion factor, spacetime as D=3+1 was born, but geometry remained a rigid, a priori  xed, background. Incidentally, it is here the 2 seeds of D > 4 were sown: D=5 was born in  at space in 1913 when Nordstr om did just the opposite of what Kaluza{Klein were to propose: he made electrodynamics part of a 5-vector in order to unify it with scalar gravity! While it was clear after 1905 that the instantaneous action-at-a-distance picture was doomed, that (at the very least) r2 had to be replaced by , what emerged initially were other simple scalar gravity models (Abraham, Mie, Poincar e) also doomed at birth, but at least not by R mer. Only Einstein kept his thoughts on the universality and accuracy (E otv os) of the inertial/gravitational mass ratio, and very likely on the fact that systems with vanishing T  would not gravitate in scalar theories. The overwhelming triumph of this period (after its gestation in 1909{1914) was of course Einstein’s general relativity (GR) in 1915. So overwhelming is this sudden revelation that we tend to forget some of its miraculous triumphs, e.g., its automatic explanation of the above mass ratios { an enormous quantitative feat (there area lot ofvery accurately measured elevators out there!), or that because special relativity is built-in as the local tangent space, this (mostly) guaranteed causal signal propagation and the observed local properties of normal non-gravitational physics. Let us also pay tribute to that incredibly useful invention, the summation convention (whoever has seen Einstein’s notes from before and after this illumination can vouch for its e ect on his work, let alone ours!). Einstein’s introduction, already in 1917, of the cosmological constant  showed his instinctive understanding that, in physics, all that is not forbidden is compulsory (or at least we don’t yet have a natural forbiddenness for  , except in one model, unbroken D=11 supergravity). Geometry,Dynamics has been the pillar of all subsequent uni cation dreams. Indeed, as in all matters, Einstein was ahead of his time: after writing G  =  2T  , he immediately asked who ordered the right-hand side. Unfortunately for him, it was the right question at the wrong time and was to lose him in his later years, but we all still pursue it, with (we hope) deeper wisdom: some version of it will always be the question. Let me cite a much less known example of Einstein’s foresight to show that great steps also engender subtleties: Very early on he realized the dangers inherent in a dynamically determined geometry: how, he asked, could we be sure that it would always be well-behaved, namely causal? He understood the horrors of time travel and predicted that \good" sources would somehow not generate \bad" spaces, and so it has turned out. The next triumphs were Schwarzschild’s rigorous black hole solution the following year, showing also that global properties count (as was realized only long after), actually preceded by Einstein’s description and calculation of the famous three tests. While we usually say that of these, only perihelion precession probes post-linearized e ects, that is a bit narrow in that linearized theory is a fundamentally inconsistent (if very useful) model. [Birkho ’s theorem, in this connection, was an early way to say there would be no monopole or dipole radiation.] Consistent cosmology started in the early twenties, with Friedmann and Lemaitre as some of its pioneers. In the same period, came the next big generalization: geometry-driven Kaluza{Klein uni cation by use of higher dimensions, for them the simplest step, D ! 5. After su ering many swings of fashion, D > 4 (or even D >> 4) seems to be here to 3 stay, as are indeed both D=3 and D=2! [As everyone at this Conference knows, the more sophisticated, Klein, version was born in Ann Arbor. Klein was simultaneously teaching GR and electromagnetism and tried to lighten his load by this stratagem; great as that version of history would be, the truth is that he was actually inspired by teaching mechanics, in fact the Hamilton{Jacobi method in background gravitational and electromagnetic  elds.] Note also the concomitant introduction of topology, i.e., compacti cation of the  fth dimension, and of global geometry to quantize a physical parameter, here electric charge, a precursor to the quantization of other constants, such as the non-Abelian Chern{Simons coe cients. After this intensively successful period, progress slowed, partly because of the irre- sistible appeal of quantum mechanics, QFT and particle physics, partly because the broad lines of the classical theory had been understood and no earthshakingly novel observations were at hand (except, as usual, in cosmology: Hubble expanded our world already in 1929). Indeed, things got moving again in a big way when GR begun to be investigated,  rst as a classical, and then more painfully as a quantum  eld theory, in the late  fties. To be sure, there was plenty of important prewar progress. A short list would include: the expres- sion, by Fock, Klein, Schr odinger, Weyl and others around 1929 of spinor theory in curved space, a formal but signi cant start towards quantum gravity, let alone supergravity! Then there was (in no particular time order) the work of Oppenheimer and his school, and Chan- drasekhar’s, on black holes, while \time travel" solutions, most notably G odel’s provided suitable puzzles. On the mathematical side we may cite the beginning of rigorous analysis of the Einstein equations as a normal hyperbolic system, with propagating and perfectly real gravitational waves (something that was not at all obvious to many people at the time) by Darmois, Lichnerowicz and his school amongst others. Perhaps more signi cant to the quantum side of our story were the early recognitions, by Rosenfeld already in 1930, that GR had to be quantized if only because its matter sources are, and by Heisenberg in 1938 that the dimensionality of the Einstein coupling constant boded ill for the ultraviolet behav- ior of quantum gravity, just as it did for the then new Fermi weak interaction model. The thirties also saw the rebirth of the linearized approximation as the  eld theory of massless spin 2 at the hands of Fierz, Pauli and independently by Bronshtein in the USSR (before he disappeared in the Stalin purges). We must also not forget the modern understanding of the stress-tensor as a (covariantly) conserved current by Belinfante and Rosenfeld. Important as it was, the progress I have traced from say 1925 to WWII was distinctly low-budget, with few adepts: it was a very unfashionable path to follow, and su ered from the absence of new experimental input as compared to lower spin physics. [To be sure, while Einstein didn’t discover GR due to immediate pressure of new data, his incorporation of hitherto unexplained observations certainly quali ed as being experimentally driven.] What were the reactions of the great quantum innovators to GR? Some of the giants of the quantum era later turned into relativists { Schr odinger was perhaps the  rst (in fact he had also worked in GR long before 1925) although he foundered on the same dead end as Einstein; Dirac started much later and stayed (mostly) within the existing theory as a dynamical system, but was also driven by the \large number problems" to consider gravity with variable gravitational constant. Pauli, whose breakthrough was (at 18) with one of the  rst texts 4 on GR, essentially stayed on the sidelines thereafter. Jordan is best remembered for the scalar-tensor theory and Klein remained active in both D=4 and 5. Others, like Bohr, Born, Heisenberg, Wigner and Planck himself, never really entered GR. Fermi’s very  rst papers (he was inspired as a young student by the Italian geometry school) were in GR, and as might be expected, are useful to this very day. The converse reaction was Einstein’s refusal to enter the promised land of QM! 4 Modern and Postmodern 1950{2000 With the general postwar physics upsurge came a new wave here as well. Initially, much talent was deployed in generating, and classifying types of solutions; this has remained an industry, with such beautiful results as the rotating black hole geometry (that seems just now to have found its observational realization!), chaotic cosmologies, \radiative" metrics and their geometric representations, as well as the deepening understanding of black holes. From the late  fties, GR began to be studied as a gauge  eld theory, to which physical concepts such as energy and the usual apparatus of Hamiltonian dynamics could be applied, under appropriate asymptotic behavior. Likewise, the covariant formulation of the theory, including the (index-heavy) perturbative calculational rules began to be used for tree, and later loop, calculations. Indeed the complications peculiar to nonabelian theories, such as ghosts and their role in keeping the rules free of unitarity paradoxes were understood here in the early sixties. The seventies brought in a wider integration into the rest of QFT. For example, gravitational conformal anomalies began to be explored by the mid-seventies. These anomalies were in turn connected to black hole radiation as part of a new (and still very strong) industry of QFT on a  xed gravitational background, that enabled progress to be made in quantized matter-gravity interactions. There was also a dark side to the new results: as Heisenberg had feared, the dimensional coupling constant of GR indeed gives rise to catastrophic ultraviolet loop e ects. [The  ip side is that the infrared end is totally unproblematic, precisely because stress tensors, i.e., vertices, contain a higher power of momentum than vector currents do.] Let’s recall rapidly what the generic problem is, say for a bosonic  eld (fermions are similar): The vertex (stress-tensor) behaves as  p p , while the propagator is  p 2. Thus the insertion of an extra internal line into a given loop order diagram involves two new vertices and three new denominators, together with a new virtual d4k integration, a process that (barring miracles) leads to increasingly virulent in nities and hence counterterms with increasing powers of curvature at each loop order. That this is also the case in practice was rapidly borne out in three di erent sectors. First, the calculational rules were su ciently streamlined to show (almost thirty years ago) that at one loop level gravity plus a scalar  eld is already non-renormalizable, requiring non-vanishing new counterterms. While pure GR, itself a self- interacting quantum system, also led to new in nities, by an accident of D=4 geometry, the corresponding terms could be removed by  eld rede nitions since they involved local terms quadratic in curvature. All these terms vanish when the external gravitational lines are 5 
Fisica Mars concretion systems. Although the analogue is not a perfect match in every geologic parameter, the mere presence of these spherical haematite concretions implies significant pore volumes of moving subsurface fluids through porous rock. Haematite is one of the few minerals found on Mars that can be linked directly to water-related processes. Utah haematite concre- tions are similar to the Mars concretions with spherical mor- phology, haematite composition, and loose, weathered accumulations. The abundance of quartz in the Utah example could pose challenges for finding spectral matches to the concre- tions.

The potential role of biomediation in the precipitation of some terrestrial haematite concretions could also hold important clues in thesearchforlifeonMars.IntriguingfactorsintheMarssystemyetto be explored include: spectral comparisons, thesource of the iron, the driving mechanism for fluid flow, and other chemical and physical parameters.

Teleportation of a quantum state encompasses the complete transfer of information from one particle to another. The com- plete specification of the quantum state of a system generally requires an infinite amount of information, even for simple two- level systems (qubits). Moreover, the principles of quantum mechanics dictate that any measurement on a system immedi- ately alters its state, while yielding at most one bit of information. The transfer of a state from one system to another (by performing measurements on the first and operations on the second) might therefore appear impossible. However, it has been shown 1 that the entangling properties of quantum mechanics, in combi- nation with classical communication, allow quantum-state tele- portation to be performed. Teleportation using pairs of entangled photons has been demonstrated 2–6 , but such tech- niques are probabilistic, requiring post-selection of measured photons. Here, we report deterministic quantum-state teleporta- tion between a pair of trapped calcium ions. Following closely the original proposal 1 , we create a highly entangled pair of ions and perform a complete Bell-state measurement involving one ion from this pair and a third source ion. State reconstruction conditioned on this measurement is then performed on the other half of the entangled pair. The measured fidelity is 75%, demonstrating unequivocally the quantum nature of the process. Teleportation of a state from a source qubit to a target qubit requires three qubits: the sender’s source qubit and an ancillary qubit that is maximally entangled with the receiver’s target qubit, providing the strong quantum correlation. Once these states have been prepared, a quantum mechanical measurement is performed jointly on the source qubit and the ancilla qubit (specifically, a Bell- state measurement, which projects the two qubits onto a basis of maximally entangled states). In this process, the two qubits are projected onto one of four equally likely outcomes. At the same time, the non-local properties of quantum mechanics cause the target qubit to be projected onto one of four corresponding states, letters to nature NATURE|VOL 429|17 JUNE 2004|www.nature.com/nature734 ©  2004 Nature  Publishing Group each relatedtotheoriginal stateof the sourcequbit, even thoughno measurement was performed on this qubit. Knowledge of the result of the source-ancilla measurement allows one to choose a simple a priori operation to be carried out on the target qubit, resulting in reconstruction of the original quantum state. Because each of the four results on the source-ancilla measurement are equally likely, regardless of the nature of the teleported state, no information about the state is obtained (thus the no-cloning theorem 7 is not violated); further, as classical communication of the measurement outcome is required to complete the state reconstruction, a state cannot be teleported faster than the speed of light. Teleportation does demonstrate a number of fascinating fundamental properties of quantum theory, in particular the non-local property of entangled states, which allows the projective measurement of the source-ancilla pair to create a definite pure state in the target qubit. Furthermore, teleportation has considerable implications for the nascent technology of quantum information processing 8 ; besides being a compelling benchmark algorithm for a three-qubit quantum computer,teleportationisapossibleprimitiveforlarge-scaledevices 9 . Experiments demonstrating qubit teleportation 2–6 , all of which used photons, were lacking the ability to perform a complete two- photon Bell-state measurement. Successful teleportation events were established by selecting the data after completion of the experiment, searching for the subset of experiments in which the outcomeof the measurement and a preset reconstruction operation were matched: that is, teleportation was performed post-selectively. One experiment 10 demonstrated unconditional teleportation of continuous variables, in this case the quadrature amplitudes of a light field. Mention should be made of a liquid-state NMR experi- ment 11 in which an ensemble of molecules was used in a highly mixed state. Our implementation of quantum teleportation uses entangled states of massive particles (see also ref. 12). For this, we store three 40 Ca þ ions in a linear Paul trap; for a detailed description of the experimental set-up, see ref. 13. The ions are arrayed in a linear crystal with an inter-ion distance of 5mm. A qubit is encoded in a superposition of the S 1/2 ground state and the metastable D 5/2 state (lifetime t < 1.16s) of a 40 Ca þ ion. Each qubit can be individually manipulated by a series of laser pulses on the j1i;S 1/2 ðm J ¼21=2Þ to j0i;D 5=2 ðm J ¼21=2Þ quadrupole transition near 729nm employing narrow-band laser radiation tightly focused onto individual ions in the string. The qubits are initialized in j1i by optical pumping. The centre-of-mass vibrational mode (q ¼ 2p£ 1.2MHz) of the ion string is cooled to the ground state as required for controlled interaction between the ions 13 . We teleport the quantum state of ion 1 (the source qubit) onto ion 3 (the target qubit) using the quantum circuit shown in Fig. 1. The sequence is formally equivalent to the one proposed by Bennett et al. 1 , but adapted to the ion-based quantum processor. As a first step we prepare ion 2 (the ancilla) and 3 in the Bell state jw þ l 23 ¼ ðj0l 2 j1l 3 þj1l 2 j0l 3 Þ= ??? 2 p ; the lifetime of which exceeds 100ms Figure 2 Result of the teleportation. The four test states are teleported with fidelities of 76%, 74%, 73% and 75%, respectively (grey bars). For each input state, 300 single teleportation experiments were performed. The error of each entry, estimated from quantum projection noise, is 2.5%. For comparison, white bars show the results if the reconstruction operations are omitted, yielding an average fidelity of 49.6%. The optimum ‘teleportation’ obtainable by purely classical means reaches a fidelity of 66.7% (dashed line). Figure3 Fidelity of teleportation as a function of the relative phase fof the reconstruction and analysing pulses (see Table 1). This is demonstrated for the test input state j1i. Varying f is used for optimizing the experimental fidelity thus accounting for a residual uncompensated phase drift during the entire process (which is the same for all input states). Figure 1 Teleportation from ion 1 to ion 3. A Bell state of ions 2 and 3 is prepared as a resource. The state to be teleported is encoded in ion 1 by the operation U x : The Bell- state analyser consists of a controlled Z-gate followed by p/2 rotations and a state detection of ions 1 and 2. Note that this implementation uses a Bell basis rotated by p/4 with respect to the standard notation. Therefore a p/2 rotation on ion 3 is required before the reconstruction operations Z and X. The latter operations are realized by a p rotation around the z and x axes, respectively. Grey lines indicate qubits that are protected against light scattering. Ions 1 and 2 are detected by observing their fluorescence on a photomultiplier tube (PMT). Only on a detection event j0i is the corresponding reconstruction operation applied to ion 3. Classical information is represented by double lines. For the fidelity analysis we apply U 21 x ; and measure the quantum state of ion 3 by observing its resonance fluorescence using a CCD camera. letters to nature NATURE|VOL 429|17 JUNE 2004|www.nature.com/nature 735 ©  2004 Nature  Publishing Group (ref. 14). Then, at any time within this lifetime, the actual tele- portation step—taking less than 2ms—can be carried out: Ion 1 is prepared in an arbitrary input state with local rotations. In our experiments the teleported state jxl was one of a set of four non- orthogonal test states jx ð1Þ l¼j1l; jx ð2Þ l¼j0l; jx ð3Þ l¼ ðj0lþj1lÞ= ??? 2 p and jx ð4Þ l¼ðij0lþj1lÞ= ??? 2 p : The Bell-state analysis is implemented by a controlled phase gate between ion 1 and 2 (ref. 11) followed by a p/2 pulse on each ion. Then the joint quantum state of ions 1 and 2 is measured by illuminating them with light at 397nm for 250ms. Detection of fluorescence indicates the projec- tion of the ion’s quantum state into the S 1/2 state, (logical j1l), whereas the absence of fluorescence indicates its projection into the j0l state with nearly 100% detection efficiency. Fluorescence is collected with a photomultiplier tube and the result is stored electronically. The measurement process must preserve the coher- ence of the target qubit, ion 3. Thus, the state of ion 3 is hidden by transferringittoasuperpositionoflevelsthatarenotaffectedbythe detection light. In Ca þ , an additional Zeeman level jHl; D 5=2 ðm J ¼25=2Þ can be used for this purpose by moving any S 1/2 population into the jHl level. The same technique is used to sequentially read out ion 1 and ion 2 and discriminate between all four possible states {j0l 1 j0l 2 ;j0l 1 j1l 2 ;j1l 1 j0l 2 ;j1l 1 j1l 2 }: Con- ditional on the measurement outcome, we apply the appropriate unitary qubit rotation, 2ij y ; 2ij z ; ij x or 1 (with Pauli operators j k ) to reconstruct the state in the target ion 3, obtaining jx ðexpÞ l: We emphasize that this conditional, deterministic step, in combination with the complete Bell-state analysis, is one of the crucial improve- ments with respect to all former experimental realizations of quantum teleportation with qubits. Furthermore, after the tele- portationprocedurethestatejxlisalwaysavailableandmaybeused for further experiments. To obtain directly the fidelity of the teleportation, we perform on ion 3 the inverse of the unitary operation U x ;jxlk1jþ j C22xlk0j;ðkxj C22xl¼ 0Þ used to create the input state from state j1l. The teleportation is successful if ion 3 is always found in j1l. The teleportation fidelity, given by the overlap F ¼k1jU 21 x r exp U x j1l; is plotted in Fig. 2 for all four test states. The obtained fidelities range from 73% to 76%. Teleportation based on a completely classical resource instead of a quantum-entangled resource yields 15 a maxi- mal possible average fidelity of 66.7% (dashed line in Fig. 2). Note, however, to rule out hidden variable theories, a fidelity in excess of 0.87 is required 16 . This level of fidelity could be reached by improv- ing primarily the magnetic-field stability and the laser-frequency noise. For comparison, we also show data where the reconstruction pulses were not applied. Without the classical information com- municated from the Bell measurement, the receiver’s state is maximally mixed, that is there is no information available on the sourcestate.Also,themeasurementoutcomesofions1and2donot contain any information about the initial state jxl: Indeed, we find each possible result with equal probability of 0.25 ^ 0.036, inde- pendent of the test input states. Note that only with both the receiver’s qubit and the result of the Bell measurement, can the initial state be retrieved. After the initial Bell-state preparation, only single qubit oper- ations are performed on the target ion (see Fig. 1). Thus, although the scheme presented here takes place in a confining potential common to all three ions, it would, in principle, be possible to separate the target ion from the other two ions. This could be realized in segmented microtrap designs as developed previously 17 , which allow separating single ions from a crystal. To illustrate further the quantum coherence of the teleportation process, we measure its fidelity as a function of the phase of the reconstructing and analysing pulses (see Fig. 3). The oscillation of the teleportation fidelity proves the phase relationship between sourceand targetqubit and thusthequantum natureof theprocess. To emphasize the role of the shared entangled pair as a resource, we store the Bell state for some time and then use it only later (after up to 10ms) for teleportation. For waiting times up to 10ms (exceeding the time we require for the teleportation by a factor of 5) we observe no decrease in the fidelity. Thus for future quantum- information processing networks, and with entangled states as a resource, quantum teleportation can be used for the distribution of quantum information between different nodes of the network. A Methods Pulse sequence To implement the teleporation we use pulses on carrier transitions R C i ðc;JÞ and R H i ðc;JÞ (no change ofthe motional state oftheion crystal)and,additionally,on the bluesideband R þ i ðc;JÞ (change of the motional state) on ion i. The index C denotes carrier transitions between the two logical eigenstates, and the index H labels the transition from the S 1/2 (m J ¼ 21/2)totheD 5/2 (m J ¼ 25/2)levelintheZeemanmanifold.Forthedefinitionsof R C;H;þ i ðc;JÞseerefs13and18.IncontrasttoFig.1,inthepulsesequence(Table1)alsothe spin-echo pulses 19 are included. These pulses make the algorithm more robust against detunings caused by slow laser and magnetic-field drifts. The timing of these generalized spin-echo pulses was found by optimizing the robustness of the sequence against detunings numerically and experimentally. The conditioned pulses 31,32,33 are applied only if less than six photon detection eventswere recorded during the respectivedetection time. For this purpose an electronic circuit counts the pulses of the photomultiplier tube and modifies the pulse sequence accordingly.

Quantum teleportation 1 provides a means to transport quantum information efficiently from one location to another, without the physical transfer of the associated quantum-information carrier. This is achieved by using the non-local correlations of previously distributed, entangled quantum bits (qubits). Teleportation is expected to play an integral role in quantum communication 2 and quantum computation 3 . Previous experimental demon- strations have been implemented with optical systems that used both discrete and continuous variables 4–9 , and with liquid- state nuclear magnetic resonance 10 . Here we report uncondi- tional teleportation 5 of massive particle qubits using atomic ( 9 Be 1 ) ions confined in a segmented ion trap, which aids individual qubit addressing. We achieve an average fidelity of 78 per cent, which exceeds the fidelity of any protocol that does not use entanglement 11 . This demonstration is also import- ant because it incorporates most of the techniques necessary for scalable quantum information processing in an ion-trap system 12,13 . Quantum teleportation 1 provides a means for transporting a quantum state between two separated parties, Alice and Bob, through the transmission of a relatively small amount of classical information. For the case of a two-state quantum system or ‘qubit’, only two bits of classical information are needed, which seems surprisingasprecisespecificationofageneralqubitstaterequiresan infinite amount of classical information. Aside from the obvious differences in the various experimental demonstrations, the basic teleportation protocol is the same 1 .

Fisica arXiv:math.HO/9911150 v1   19 Nov 1999 Machines, Logic and Quantum Physics David Deutsch and Artur Ekert Centre for Quantum Computation, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PU, U.K. Rossella Lupacchini Dipartimento di Filoso a, Universita di Bologna, Via Zamboni 38, 40126 Bologna, Italy. 19 November 1999 Abstract Though the truths of logic and pure mathematics are objective and independent of any contingent facts or laws of nature, our knowledge of these truths depends entirely on our knowledge of the laws of physics. Recent progress in the quantum theory of computation has provided practical instances of this, and forces us to abandon the classical view that computation, and hence mathematical proof, are purely logical notions independent of that of computation as a physical process. Henceforward, a proof must be regarded not as an abstract object or process but as a physical process, a species of computation, whose scope and reliability depend on our knowledge of the physics of the computer concerned. 1 Mathematics and the physical world Genuine scienti c knowledge cannot be certain, nor can it be justi ed a priori. Instead, it must be conjectured, and then tested by experiment, and this requires it to be expressed in a language appropriate for making precise, empirically testable predictions. That language is mathematics. 1 This in turn constitutes a statement about what the physical world must be like if science, thus conceived, is to be possible. As Galileo put it, \the universe is written in the language of mathematics"[5]. Galileo’s introduc- tion of mathematically formulated, testable theories into physics marked the transition from the Aristotelian conception of physics, resting on supposedly necessary a priori principles, to its modern status as a theoretical, conjec- tural and empirical science. Instead of seeking an infallible universal math- ematical design, Galilean science uses mathematics to express quantitative descriptions of an objective physical reality. Thus mathematics has become the language in which we express our knowledge of the physical world. This language is not only extraordinarily powerful and precise, but also e ective in practice. Eugene Wigner referred to \the unreasonable e ectiveness of mathematics in the physical sciences"[12]. But is this e ectiveness really unreasonable or miraculous? Consider how we learn about mathematics. Do we { that is, do our brains { have direct access to the world of abstract concepts and the relations between them (as Plato believed, and as Roger Penrose now advocates[8]), or do we learn mathematics by experience, that is by interacting with physical objects? We believe the latter. This is not to say that the subject-matter of mathematical theories is in any sense part of, or emerges out of, the physical world. We do not deny that numbers, sets, groups and algebras have an autonomous reality quite independent of what the laws of physics decree, and the properties of these mathematical structures are just as objective as Plato believed they were. But they are revealed to us only through the physical world. It is only physical objects, such as computers or human brains, that ever give us glimpses of the abstract world of mathematics. But how? It is a familiar fact, and has been since the prehistoric beginnings of mathematics, that simple physical systems like  ngers, tally sticks and the abacus can be used to represent some mathematical entities and operations. Historically the operations of elementary arithmetic were also the  rst to be delegated to more complex machines. As soon as it became clear that additions and multiplications can be performed by a sequence of basic pro- cedures and that these procedures are implementable as physical operations, mechanical devices designed by Blaise Pascal, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and others began to relieve humans from tedious tasks such as multiplying two large integers [6]. In the twentieth century, following this conquest of arith- metic, the logical concept of computability was the next to be delegated to 2 machines. Turing machines were invented in order to formalise the notion of \e ectiveness" inherent in the intuitive idea of calculability. Alan Tur- ing conjectured that the theoretical machines in terms of which he de ned computation are capable of performing any  nite, e ective procedure (algo- rithm). It is worth noting that Turing machines were intended to reproduce every de nite operation that a human computer could perform, following preassigned instructions. Turing’s method was to think in terms of physical operations, and imagine that every operation performed by the computer \consists of some change of the physical system consisting of the computer and his tape"[11]. The key point is that since the outcome is not a ected by constructing \a machine to do the work of this computer", the e ectiveness of a human computer can be mimicked by a logical machine. The Turing machine was an abstract construct, but thanks to subse- quent developments in the theory of computation, algorithms can now be performed by real automatic computing machines. The natural question now arises: what, precisely, is the set of logical procedures that can be per- formed by a physical device? The theory of Turing machines cannot, even in principle, answer this question, nor can any approach based on formalising traditional notions of e ective procedures. What we need instead is to ex- tend Turing’s idea of mechanising procedures, in particular, the procedures involved in the notion of derivability. This would de ne mathematical proofs as being mechanically reproducible and to that extent e ectively veri able. The universality and reliability of logical procedures would be guaranteed by the mechanical procedures that e ectively perform logical operations { but by no more than that. But what does it mean to involve real, physical machines in the de nition of a logical notion? and what might this imply in return about the ‘reasonableness’ or otherwise of the e ectiveness of physics in the mathematical sciences? While the abstract model of a machine, as used in the classical theory of computation, is a pure-mathematical construct to which we can attribute any consistent properties we may  nd convenient or pleasing, a considera- tion of actual computing machines as physical objects must take account of their actual physical properties, and therefore, in particular, of the laws of physics. Turing’s machines (with arbitrarily long tapes) can be built, but no one would ever do so except for fun, as they would be extremely slow and cumbersome. We  nd the computers now available much faster and more reliable. Where does this reliability come from? How do we know that the computer generates the same outputs as the appropriate abstract Tur- 3 ing machine, that the machinery of cog-wheels must  nally display the right answer? After all, nobody has tested the machine by following all possible logical steps, or by performing all the arithmetic it can perform. If they were able and willing to do that, there would be no need to build the computer in the  rst place. The reason we trust the machine cannot be based entirely on logic; it must also involve our knowledge of the physics of the machine. We take for granted the laws of physics that govern the computation, i.e. the physical process that takes the machine from an initial state (input) to a  nal state (output). Moreover, our understanding is informed by physical theories which, though formulated in mathematical terms in the tradition of Galileo, evolved by conjectures and empirical refutations. In this perspective, what Turing really asserted was that it is possible to build a universal computer, a machine that can be programmed to perform any computation that any other physical object can perform. That is to say, a single buildable physical object, given only proper maintenance and a supply of energy and additional memory when needed, can mimic all the behavior and responses of any other physically possible object or process. In this form Turing’s conjecture (which Deutsch has called in this context the Church-Turing principle [3]) can be viewed as a statement about the physical world. Are there any limits to computations performed by computing machines? Obviously there are both logical and physical limits. Logic tells us that, for example, no machine can  nd more than one even prime, whilst physics tells us that, for example, no computations can violate the laws of thermodynam- ics. Moreover, logical and physical limitations can be intimately linked, as illustrated by the "halting problem" . According to logic, the halting prob- lem says that there is no algorithm for deciding whether any given machine, when started from any given initial situation, eventually stops. Therefore some computational problems, such as determining whether a speci ed uni- versal Turing machine, given a speci ed input, will halt, cannot be solved by any Turing machine. In physical terms, this statement says that ma- chines with certain properties cannot be physically built, and as such can be viewed as a statement about physical reality or equivalently about the laws of physics. So where does mathematical e ectiveness come from? It is not simply a miracle, \a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve" [12] { at least, no more so than our ability to discover empirical knowledge, for our knowledge of mathematics and logic is inextricably entangled with our knowledge of physical reality: every mathematical proof depends for its ac- 4 ceptance upon our agreement about the rules that govern the behavior of physical objects such as computers or our brains. Hence when we improve our knowledge about physical reality, we may also gain new means of im- proving our knowledge of logic, mathematics and formal notions. It seems that we have no choice but to recognize the dependence of our mathematical knowledge (though not, we stress, of mathematical truth itself) on physics, and that being so, it is time to abandon the classical view of computation as a purely logical notion independent of that of computation as a physical process. In the following we discuss how the discovery of quantum mechanics in particular has changed our understanding of the nature of computation. 2 Quantum interference To explain what makes quantum computers so di erent from their classical counterparts, we begin with the phenomenon of quantum interference. Con- sider the following computing machine whose input can be prepared in one of two states representing, 0 and 1. Figure 1: Schematic representation of the most general machine that per- forms a computation mapping f0;1g to itself. Here pij is the probability for the machine to produce the output j when presented with the input i. (The action of the machine depends on no other input or stored information.) The machine has the property that if we prepare its input with the value a (a = 0 or 1) and then measure the output, we obtain, with probability pab, the value b (b = 0 or 1). It may seem obvious that if the pab are arbitrary apart from satisfying the standard probability conditions Pbpab = 1, Fig. (1) represents the most general machine whose action depends on no other input or stored information and which performs a computation mapping f0;1g to itself. The two possible deterministic limits are obtained by setting p01 = 5 
Fisica PHYSICS, PHILOSOPHY AND QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY DAVID DEUTSCH Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom E-mail: david.deutsch@qubit.org Quantum theory and the classical theory of computation were perfected in the 1930s, and fifty years later they were unified to form the quantum theory of computation. Here I want to tell you about a speculation — I can’t call it more than a “speculation” even though I know it’s true — about the kind of theory that might, in another fifty years’ time, supersede or transcend the quantum theory of computation. There are branches of science — in fact most of them are branches of physics — that we expect, by their nature, to have philosophical implications. An obvious example is cosmology. There are other sciences, such as, say, aerodynamics, in which, no matter how startling or important our discoveries may become, we do not expect fundamental philosophical implications. So, various sciences fall at di?erent places on a scale (Fig. 1) ranging from the most fundamental on the left to the least fundamental, the most derivative, on the right. CosmologyElementary Particle  Physics Astrophysics Chemistry Zoology Aerodynamics Fundamental Derivative Figure 1. Placing sciences on a scale from fundamental to derivative. The same holds for mathematics. There are branches of mathematics, such as logic, that we expect by their nature to be relevant to philosophical issues. Then there are other branches, for instance Fourier analysis, which, although they might be very useful both in mathematics itself and in practical applications, are not expected to be philosophically interesting. The vertical axis of Fig. 2(a) measures how mathematical a field is. Halfway up is the line of demarcation between science (which has empirical content) and mathematics (which is purely abstract). Now, where does the theory of computation lie on that diagram? Tra- ditionally the answer would have been that it is a branch of mathematics, but not a fundamental one: Kronecker said that God made the integers and all the rest is the work of man; more modern formulations give set theory pride of place. So the theory of computation might have been placed at about position 1 on Fig. 2(b). But in the twentieth century, G¨odel and Turing ar- gued that the theory of computation ought to be isomorphic to proof theory, 1 DerivativeFundamental More Mathematical Less Mathematical SCIENCE MATHEMATICS Set Theory Logic Arithmetic Geometry Fourier Analysis Aerodynamics Zoology Elephants Theory of Evolution 1 2 Computation?

Such assessments would put it far away at position 2. What about the theories of information and communication? They were studied under the heading of physics, and would also have been placed well to the right, on the derivative side of the diagram, for all our results in these fields are obtained by taking fundamental theories like the superposition principle and quantum electrodynamics, and deriving conclusions from them. We do not add any new laws. So we regard our knowledge of the physical world as being structured in the manner of Fig. 3(a): we have laws that apply to absolutely everything, and we apply them to special cases. There’s cosmology, and one branch of cosmol- ogy would be the physics of galaxies. Within that, there’s the physics of solar systems, and within solar systems, planets. On planets, we have quantum computers, elephants, and so on. Alternatively, we can think of elementary particle physics which describes the behavior of all particles in full general- ity; solid state physics is a special case, and so on up to elephants, humans and quantum computers. Either way, the theory of computers, even quantum computers, would seem to be a highly specialized subfield of a subfield of fun- damental physics. After all, it’s quite hard to make quantum computers. As far as we know, there are nowhere near as many of them in the universe as there are stars or even elephants. As far as we know there aren’t any at all, yet. And in any case, it seems that when we’re studying quantum computers we’re studying how matter and energy behave under extremely unusual and contrived circumstances — something that may possibly be important to us for practical reasons, but of no fundamental significance. Yet we know that that is the wrong conclusion. We know it because of the existence of compu- tational universality: the laws of physics allow for a machine — a universal quantum computer — with the property that its possible motions correspond 2 Quantum Theory  of Computation?

Right panel: (b) the encompassing role of quantum computation: does it include all of physics? in a suitable sense to all possible motions of all possible physical objects. Therefore the whole of physics and more — the study of all possible physical objects — is just isomorphic to the study of all programs that could run on a universal quantum computer. So the world view portrayed in Fig. 3(a) is wrong, and we’re led to a di?er- ent picture of the relationship between the various sciences, namely Fig. 3(b), in which physics is the quantum theory of computation, and the study of particular physical systems is the study of particular classes of computations. So again galaxies stars and elephants will appear somewhere in this diagram as special cases, but the study of quantum computers is represented by the whole diagram. [As Charles Bennett has pointed out — when I presented this paper at the conference — the quantum theory of computation still does appear as a small region of the diagram as well, but that region has the same structure as the diagram as a whole.] Yet, even though Fig. 3(b) is our best way of conceiving of the character of physical law, most of our world-views still incorporate something more like the obsolete Fig. 3(a), in which a universal computer is just another physical system. The reason is partly inertia. It is also partly the way in which quantum physics is taught: a course that started with qubits and quantum computational networks instead of the Schr¨odinger equation and the square well would not only be far closer to the physical foundations of the theory but also inherently simpler. This would have the further merit of allowing quantum theory to be taught earlier in a physics curriculum. But I digress. There is also a good reason for not accepting Fig. 3(b), the computational view of nature, our best available view, as the whole story either. Admittedly it is very natural, when one has understood the centrality of computation in physics, to make certain speculations about what may be: 3 maybe the universe that we see — or presumably the multiverse — is really a computer program running on a giant computer. That’s an intriguing idea and a rich source of science-fiction plots, but as physics, it is a fundamentally flawed idea. It is a retrograde step in understanding what quantum compu- tation and universality are telling us, and that is for two main reasons. The first is that any cosmology of that type entails giving up on explanations. Forifwhat we see as the laws of physics are actually just attributes of some software, then by the very definition of computational universality, we then have no means of understanding the hardware on which that software is run- ning. So we have no way of understanding the real physics of reality. Thus for this reason, because the properties of this supposed outer-level hardware would never figure in any of our explanations of anything, we have no more reason for postulating that it’s there than we have for postulating that there are fairies at the bottom of the garden. That’s a philosophical, or methodological reason. The second reason why I think this idea would be a non-starter is a more technical one, but it too is a killer. We see around us a computable universe; that is to say, of all possible mathematical objects and relationships, only an infinitesimal propor- tion are ever instantiated in the relationships of physical objects and physical processes. (These are essentially the computable functions.) Now it might seem that one approach to explaining that amazing fact, is to say “the rea- son why physical processes conform to this very small part of mathematics, ‘computable mathematics,’ is that physical processes really are computations running on a computer external to what we think of as physical reality.” But that relies on the assumption that the set of computable functions — the Turing computable functions, or the set of quantum computable operations —issomehow inherently privileged within mathematics. So that even a com- puter implemented in unknown physics (the supposed computer that we’re all simulations on) would be expected to conform to those same notions of computability, to use those same functions that mathematics designates as computable. But in fact, the only thing that privileges the set of all com- putational operations that we see in nature, is that they are instantiated by the laws of physics. It is only through our knowledge of the physical world that we know of the di?erence between computable and not computable. So it’s only through our laws of physics that the nature of computation can be understood. It can never be vice versa. Another of these very natural speculations is that maybe there isn’t just one giant computer but an infinite number of them, all running di?erent programs. Or else, forget the computers (the argument I’ve just given tells us that we have to). We could speculate that there are just many universes all running di?erent laws of physics, as, for instance, in the evolutionary universe idea of Lee Smolin, or the ideas of Seth Lloyd or Max Tegmark. Now I have no objection to the idea that multiple laws of physics in di?erent universes will be implicated in future explanations of the physical world, but it cannot 4 QUANTUM THEORY  OF COMPUTATION Thermodynamics QUANTUM THEORY  OF COMPUTATION Thermodynamics QUANTUM  CONSTRUCTOR  THEORY Figure 4.

It cannot even be the gist of the explanation — for essentially the same reason as the universe-is-a-simulation idea: there is no notion of computation prior to the laws of physics, indeed, there’s no notion of laws at all prior to a definition of what is or isn’t computable. Thus, the very power of the principle of the universality of computation, which gives us such a unified view of what physics is, also limits the extent to which physical reality can be regarded as consisting of computations. Be- cause of universality, the nature of computation and the laws governing it are independent of the underlying hardware. Therefore those laws, and that the- ory, can’t explain hardware. Explaining hardware, however, is obviously part of science. Hence there must be something to physics beyond the quantum theory of computation. I think we have to conceive of the quantum theory of computation as a special case of a bigger theory: quantum constructor theory, which is the theory of what physical objects can be constructed, using what resources. Here I don’t mean abstract resources, like the number of computa- tional steps or the amount of memory, but physical resources like atoms and energy and entropy and so on. We do already have some hints about constructor theory: it’s not quite true that all of existing physics can be understood as being various aspects of the quantum theory of computation. For instance, we know that it is not possible to build a perpetual motion machine of the second kind. We have alaw of physics that tells us so. Yet as far as the quantum theory of com- putation goes, the time reverse of any physical state is just another physical state. Universality says that the evolution of that state can be simulated by the universal computer with arbitrary accuracy. So the quantum theory of computation does not have the wherewithal to accommodate the whole of, say, quantum statistical mechanics within it [Fig. 4(a)]. 5 
Fisica Quantum theory, the Church-Turing principle and the universal quantum computer DAV I D DEUTSCH #03 Appeared in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A 400, pp. 97-117 (1985) y (Communicated by R. Penrose, F.R.S. — Received 13 July 1984) Abstract It is argued that underlying the Church-Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical prin- ciple: ‘every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means’. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Tur- ing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the ‘universal quantum computer’ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines re- sembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism’, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be per- formed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett’s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the ‘complexity’ or ‘knowledge’ in a physical system than does clas- sical complexity theory. #03 Current address: Centre for Quantum Computation, Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, Parks Road, OX1 3PU Oxford, United Kingdom.

Email: wimvdam@qubit.org 1 Computing machines and the Church-Turing principle The theory of computing machines has been extensively developed during the last few decades. In- tuitively, a computing machine is any physical system whose dynamical evolution takes it from one of a set of ‘input’ states to one of a set of ‘output’ states. The states are labelled in some canonical way, the machine is prepared in a state with a given input label and then, following some motion, the output state is measured. For a classical deterministic system the measured output label is a definite function f of the prepared input label; moreover the value of that label can in principle be measured by an outside observer (the ‘user’) and the machine is said to ‘compute’ the function f. Two classical deterministic computing machines are ‘computationally equivalent’ under given la- bellings of their input and output states if they compute the same function under those labellings. But quantum computing machines, and indeed classical stochastic computing machines, do not ‘compute functions’ in the above sense: the output state of a stochastic machine is random with only the prob- ability distribution function for the possible outputs depending on the input state. The output state of a quantum machine, although fully determined by the input state is not an observable and so the user cannot in general discover its label. Nevertheless, the notion of computational equivalence can be generalized to apply to such machines also. Again we define computational equivalence under given labellings, but it is now necessary to specify more precisely what is to be labelled. As far as the input is concerned, labels must be given for each of the possible ways of preparing the machine, which correspond, by definition, to all the pos- sible input states. This is identical with the classical deterministic case. However, there is an asymme- try between input and output because there is an asymmetry between preparation and measurement: whereas a quantum system can be prepared in any desired permitted input state, measurement can- not in general determine its output state; instead one must measure the value of some observable. (Throughout this paper I shall be using the Schr¨odinger picture, in which the quantum state is a func- tion of time but observables are constant operators.) Thus what must be labelled is the set of ordered pairs consisting of an output observable and a possible measured value of that observable (in quantum theory, a Hermitian operator and one of its eigenvalues). Such an ordered pair contains, in effect, the specification of a possible experiment that could be made on the output, together with a possible result of that experiment. Two computing machines are computationally equivalent under given labellings if in any possi- ble experiment or sequence of experiments in which their inputs were prepared equivalently under the input labellings, and observables corresponding to each other under the output labellings were measured, the measured values of these observables for the two machines would be statistically indis- tinguishable. That is, the probability distribution functions for the outputs of the two machines would be identical. In the sense just described, a given computing machineMcomputes at most one function. How- ever, there ought to be no fundamental difference between altering the input state in which M is prepared, and altering systematically the constitution ofMso that it becomes a different machineM 0 computing a different function. To formalize such operations, it is often useful to consider machines with two inputs, the preparation of one constituting a ‘program’ determining which function of the other is to be computed. To each such machineMthere corresponds a set C#28M#29 of ‘M-computable functions’. A function f isM-computable ifMcan compute f when prepared with some program. The set C#28M#29 can be enlarged by enlarging the set of changes in the constitution of M that are labelled as possible M-programs. Given two machines M and M 0 it is possible to construct a composite machine whose set of computable functions contains the union of C#28M#29 and C#28M 0 #29. There is no purely logical reason why one could not go on ad infinitum building more powerful 2 computing machines, nor why there should exist any function that is outside the computable set of every physically possible machine. Yet although logic does not forbid the physical computation of ar- bitrary functions, it seems that physics does. As is well known, when designing computing machines one rapidly reaches a point when adding additional hardware does not alter the machine’s set of com- putable functions (under the idealization that the memory capacity is in effect unlimited); moreover, for functions from the integers Zto themselves the set C#28M#29 is always contained in C#28T#29,whereT is Turing’s universal computing machine (Turing 1936). C#28T#29 itself, also known as the set of recursive functions, is denumerable and therefore infinitely smaller than the set of all functions from Z to Z. Church (1936) and Turing (1936) conjectured that these limitations on what can be computed are not imposed by the state-of-the-art in designing computing machines, nor by our ingenuity in constructing models for computation, but are universal. This is called the ‘Church-Turing hypothesis’; according to Turing, Every ‘function which would naturally be regarded as computable’ can be computed by the universal Turing machine. (1.1) The conventional, non-physical view of (1.1) interprets it as the quasi-mathematical conjecture that all possible formalizations of the intuitive mathematical notion of ‘algorithm’ or ‘computation’ are equivalent to each other. But we shall see that it can also be regarded as asserting a new physical principle, which I shall call the Church-Turing principle to distinguish it from other implications and connotations of the conjecture (1.1). Hypothesis (1.1) and other formulations that exist in the literature (see Hofstadter (1979) for an interesting discussion of various versions) are very vague by comparison with physical principles such as the laws of thermodynamics or the gravitational equivalence principle. But it will be seen below that my statement of the Church-Turing principle (1.2) is manifestly physical, and unambiguous. I shall show that it has the same epistemological status as other physical principles. I propose to reinterpret Turing’s ‘functions which would naturally be regarded as computable’ as the functions which may in principle be computed by a real physical system. For it would surely be hard to regard a function ‘naturally’ as computable if it could not be computed in Nature, and conversely. To this end I shall define the notion of ‘perfect simulation’. A computing machine M is capable of perfectly simulating a physical system S, under a given labelling of their inputs and outputs, if there exists a program #19#28S#29 forMthat rendersMcomputationally equivalent toS under that labelling. In other words, #19#28S#29 convertsMinto a ‘black box’ functionally indistinguishable from S. I can now state the physical version of the Church- Turing principle: ‘Every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means’. (1.2) This formulation is both better defined and more physical than Turing’s own way of expressing it (1.1), because it refers exclusively to objective concepts such as ‘measurement’, ‘preparation’ and ‘physical system’, which are already present in measurement theory. It avoids terminology like ‘would naturally be regarded’, which does not fit well into the existing structure of physics. The ‘finitely realizable physical systems’ referred to in (1.2) must include any physical object upon which experimentation is possible. The ‘universal computing machine’ on the other hand, need only be an idealized (but theoretically permitted) finitely specifiable model. The labellings implicitly referred to in (1.2) must also be finitely specifiable. The reference in (1.1) to a specific universal computing machine (Turing’s) has of necessity been replaced in (1.2) by the more general requirement that this machine operate ‘by finite means’. ‘Finite 3 means’ can be defined axiomatically, without restrictive assumptions about the form of physical laws (cf. Gandy 1980). If we think of a computing machine as proceeding in a sequence of steps whose duration has a non-zero lower bound, then it operates by ‘finite means’ if (i) only a finite subsystem (though not always the same one) is in motion during anyone step, and (ii) the motion depends only on the state of a finite subsystem, and (iii) the rule that specifies the motion can be given finitely in the mathematical sense (for example as an integer). Turing machines satisfy these conditions, and so does the universal quantum computerQ(seex2). The statement of the Church-Turing principle (1.2) is stronger than what is strictly necessitated by (1.1). Indeed it is so strong that it is not satisfied by Turing’s machine in classical physics. Owing to the continuity of classical dynamics, the possible states of a classical system necessarily form a continuum. Yet there are only countably many ways of preparing a finite input forT. Consequently T cannot perfectly simulate any classical dynamical system. (The well studied theory of the ‘simu- lation’ of continuous systems byT concerns itself not with perfect simulation in my sense but with successive discrete approximation.) Inx3, I shall show that it is consistent with our present knowledge of the interactions present in Nature that every real (dissipative) finite physical system can be perfectly simulated by the universal quantum computerQ. Thus quantum theory is compatible with the strong form (1.2) of the Church-Turing principle. I now return to my argument that (1.2) is an empirical assertion. The usual criterion for the empiri- cal status of a theory is that it be experimentally falsifiable (Popper 1959), i.e. that there exist potential observations that would contradict it. However, since the deeper theories we call ‘principles’ make reference to experiment only via other theories, the criterion of falsifiability must be applied indirectly in their case. The principle of conservation of energy, for example, is not in itself contradicted by any conceivable observation because it contains no specification of how to measure energy. The third law of thermodynamics whose form ‘No finite process can reduce the entropy or temperature of a finitely realizable physical system to zero’ (1.3) bears a certain resemblance to that of the Church-Turing principle, is likewise not directly refutable: no temperature measurement of finite accuracy could distinguish absolute zero from an arbitrarily small positive temperature. Similarly, since the number of possible programs for a universal computer is infinite, no experiment could in general verify that none of them can simulate a system that is thought to be a counter-example to (1.2). But all this does not place ‘principles’ outside the realm of empirical science. On the contrary, they are essential frameworks within which directly testable theories are formulated. Whether or not a given physical theory contradicts a principle is first determined by logic alone. Then, if the directly testable theory survives crucial tests but contradicts the principle, that principle is deemed to be refuted, albeit indirectly. If all known experimentally corroborated theories satisfy a restrictive principle, then that principle is corroborated and becomes, on the one hand, a guide in the construction of new theories, and on the other, a means of understanding more deeply the content of existing theories. It is often claimed that every ‘reasonable’ physical (as opposed to mathematical) model for com- putation, at least for the deterministic computation of functions from Z to Z, is equivalent to Turing’s. But this is not so; there is no apriorireason why physical laws should respect the limitations of the mathematical processes we call ‘algorithms’ (i.e. the functions C#28T#29). Although I shall not in this paper find it necessary to do so, there is nothing paradoxical or inconsistent in postulating physical systems which compute functions not in C(T). There could be experimentally testable theories to that 4 effect: e.g. consider any recursively enumerable non-recursive set (such as the set of integers rep- resenting programs for terminating algorithms on a given Turing machine). In principle, a physical theory might have among its implications that a certain physical device F could compute in a spec- ified time whether or not an arbitrary integer in its input belonged to that set. This theory would be experimentally refuted if a more pedestrian Turing-type computer, programmed to enumerate the set, ever disagreed withF. (Of course the theory would have to make other predictions as well, otherwise it could never be non-trivially corroborated, and its structure would have to be such that its exotic pre- dictions aboutF could not naturally be severed from its other physical content. All this is logically possible.) Nor, conversely, is it obvious apriorithat any of the familiar recursive functions is in physical reality computable. The reason why we find it possible to construct, say, electronic calculators, and indeed why we can perform mental arithmetic, cannot be found in mathematics or logic. The reason is that the laws of physics ‘happen to’ permit the existence of physical models for the operations of arithmetic such as addition, subtraction and multiplication. If they did not, these familiar operations would be non-computable functions. We might still know of them and invoke them in mathematical proofs (which would presumably be called ‘non-constructive’) but we could not perform them. If the dynamics of some physical system did depend on a function not in C#28T#29, then that system could in principle be used to compute the function. Chaitin (1977) has shown how the truth values of all ‘interesting’ non-Turing decidable propositions of a given formal system might be tabulated very efficiently in the first few significant digits of a single physical constant. But if they were, it might be argued, we could never know because we could not check the accu- racy of the ‘table’ provided by Nature. This is a fallacy. The reason why we are confident that the machines we call calculators do indeed compute the arithmetic functions they claim to compute is not that we can ‘check’ their answers, for this is ultimately a futile process of comparing one machine with another: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? The real reason is that we believe the detailed physical theory that was used in their design. That theory, including its assertion that the abstract functions of arithmetic are realized in Nature, is empirical. 2 Quantum computers Every existing general model of computation is effectively classical. That is, a full specification of its state at any instant is equivalent to the specification of a set of numbers, all of which are in principle measurable. Yet according to quantum theory there exist no physical systems with this property. The fact that classical physics and the classical universal Turing machine do not obey the Church-Turing principle in the strong physical form (1.2) is one motivation for seeking a truly quantum model. The more urgent motivation is, of course, that classical physics is false. Benioff (1982) has constructed a model for computation within quantum kinematics and dynam- ics, but it is still effectively classical in the above sense. It is constructed so that at the end of each elementary computational step, no characteristically quantum property of the model —interference, non-separability, or indeterminism — can be detected. Its computations can be perfectly simulated by a Turing machine. Feynman (1982) went one step closer to a true quantum computer with his ‘universal quantum simulator’. This consists of a lattice of spin systems with nearest-neighbour interactions that are freely specifiable. Although it can surely simulate any system with a finite-dimensional state space (I do not understand why Feynman doubts that it can simulate fermion systems), it is not a computing machine in the sense of this article. ‘Programming’ the simulator consists of endowing it by fiat with 5

We have followed a philosophy of directness and simplicity, while still allowing contributors flexibility to expand in their own areas of expertise. They are cited in the contributors’ list, but I take this opportunity to thank the contributors for their efforts and their patience. The subject areas of this dictionary at the time of this writing are among the most active of the physical sciences. Astrophysics and astronomy are enjoying a new golden era, with remarkable observations in new wave bands (?-rays, X-rays, infrared, radio) and in new fields: neutrino and (soon) gravitational wave astronomy. High resolution mapping of planets continuously yields new discoveries in the history and the environment of the solar system. Theoretical developments are matching these observational results, with new understandings from the largest cosmological scale to the interior of the planets. Geophysics mirrors and drives this research in its study of our own planet, and the analogies it finds in other solar system bodies. Climate change (atmospheric and oceanic long-timescale dynamics) is a transcendingly important societal, as well as scientific, issue. This dictionary provides the background and context for development for decades to come in these and related fields. It is our hope that this dictionary will be of use to students and established researchers alike. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the assistance of Dr. Helen Nelson, and later, Ms. Colleen McMil- lon, in the construction of this work. Finally, I acknowledge the debt I owe to Dr. C.F. Keller, and to the late Prof. Dennis Sciama, who so broadened my horizons in the subjects of this dictionary. Richard Matzner Austin, Texas © 2001 by CRC Press LLC

Introduction This is an almost literal write-up of the 14 lectures I gave at the 1995 Les Houches school Quantum Symmetry, plus an extra lecture on BPS states and D-branes that sum- marizes some important developments that have taken place after the school. It should be regarded as a broad-brushed sketch of modern views on quantum  eld theory and string theory, stressing moduli spaces, duality and the interconnectedness of the subject. I have taken perhaps a more mathematical point of view than is usual in these kind of introduc- tory texts. I also tried to emphasize the common themes of various  elds, perhaps at the expense of completeness and many details. In the last decades, in a long series of abstractions and generalizations, string theory has emerged as the leading candidate for a fundamental theory of nature. Part of the motivation is (unfortunately, from a physical point of view) the intrinsic mathematical beauty of the theory. In fact, both directly and indirectly string theory has in uenced various mathematical  elds, and vice versa string theory has been in uenced by recent mathematical development. In the last two years we have witnessed a marked change in pace in all this. In a con uence of a wide variety of ideas, many of them dating back to the 70s and 80s, the structure, internal consistency and beauty of string theory has greatly improved. We have now a much better and clearer picture of what string theory is about. Somehow the original concept of one-dimensional strings generalizing zero-dimensional point particles has become less central. The extended nature of the string and the in nite tower of oscillations that comes with it, serves more to naturally regularize the important  eld-theoretic massless excitations that include the gravitons and gauge bosons that mediate the uni ed forces. Indeed, it is not at all clear that the massive modes will form stable asymptotic states that can be (in principal) observed. More than just a generalization of  eld theory, the crucial fact seems to be that string theory leads by itself naturally to the most important physical principles, such a quantum mechanics, general relativity, gauge theories and supersymmetry, without assuming these from the beginning. Indeed, it seems that any quantum theory that combines these four ingredients has to be a string theory. One therefore gets a the feeling that we are essentially dealing with a unique, very constrained object. The precise mathematical de nition of this object still eludes us, but the remarkable internal consistency has been a constant source of new insights in the nature of quantum systems, the dynamics of gauge theories, the geometry of space-time, and last but not least a wonderful inspiration for beautiful mathematics. Crucial in all the recent developments has been the concept of duality. In fact, duality has been a powerful idea in physics for a long time, both in statistical mechanics and  eld theory. In many respects duality in  eld theory and string theory can be used as an organizing principle, as I will try to do in these lectures. 5 
Fisica DIRAC-HESTENES SPINOR FIELDS IN RIEMANN-CARTAN SPACETIME ? W. A. RODRIGUES, JR., Q. A. G. DE SOUZA and J. VAZ, JR. Departamento de Matem´atica Aplicada Universidade Estadual de Campinas 13081–970, Campinas, SP, Brazil email: walrod@ime.unicamp.br and P. LOUNESTO Department of Mathematics Helsinki University of Technology SF-02150 Espoo, Finland Abstract. In this paper we study Dirac-Hestenes spinor fields (DHSF) on a four-dimensional Riemann-Cartan spacetime (RCST). We prove that these fields must be defined as certain equiva- lence classes of even sections of the Cli?ord bundle (over the RCST), thereby being certain particular sections of a new bundle named Spin-Cli?ord bundle (SCB). The conditions for the existence of the SCB are studied and are shown to be equivalent to the famous Geroch’s theorem concerning to the existence of spinor structures in a Lorentzian spacetime. We introduce also the covariant and algebraic Dirac spinor fields and compare these with DHSF, showing that all the three kinds of spinor fields contain the same mathematical and physical information. We clarify also the notion of (Crumeyrolle’s) amorphous spinors (Dirac-K¨ahler spinor fields are of this type), showing that they cannot be used to describe fermionic fields. We develop a rigorous theory for the covariant derivatives of Cli?ord fields (sections of the Cli?ord bundle (CB)) and of Dirac-Hestenes spinor fields. We show how to generalize the original Dirac-Hestenes equation in Minkowski spacetime for the case of a RCST. Our results are obtained from a variational principle formulated through the multiform derivative approach to Lagrangian field theory in the Cli?ord bundle. 1. Introduction In the following we study the theory of Dirac-Hestenes spinor fields (DHSF) and the theory of their covariant derivatives on a Riemann-Cartan spacetime (RCST). We also show how to generalize the so-called Dirac-Hestenes equation – originally introduced in (Hestenes, 1967;1976) for the formulation of Dirac theory of the elec- tron using the spacetime algebra Clscript 1,3 in Minkowski spacetime – for an arbitrary Riemann-Cartan spacetime. We use an approach based on the multiform derivative formulation of Lagrangian field theory to obtain the above results. They are im- portant for the study of spinor fields in gravitational theory and are essential for an understanding of the relationship between Maxwell and Dirac theories and quantum mechanics (Vaz and Rodrigues, 1993; 1995). In order to achieve our goals we start clarifying many misconceptions concern- ing the usual presentation of the theory of covariant, algebraic and Dirac-Hestenes 0 ? accepted for publication, Int. J. Theor. Physics, 1996 2 spinors. Section 2 is dedicated to this subject and we must say that it improves over other presentations – e.g., (Vaz and Rodrigues, 1993; Figueiredo et al., 1990; Figueiredo et al., 1990a; Rodrigues and Oliveira, 1990; Rodrigues and Figueiredo, 1990; Lounesto, 1993; Lounesto, 1993a; Benn and Tucker, 1987; Blau, 1985) – intro- ducing a new and important fact, namely that all kind of spinors referred above must be defined as special equivalence classes in appropriate Cli?ord algebras. The hidden geometrical meaning of the covariant Dirac Spinor is disclosed and the physical and geometrical meaning of the famous Fierz identities (Rodrigues and Figueiredo, 1990; Lounesto, 1993; Fierz, 1937; Crawford, 1985) becomes obvious. In Section 3 we study the Cli?ord bundle of a Riemann-Cartan spacetime (Souza and Rodrigues, 1993) and its irreducible module representations. This permit us to define Dirac-Hestenes spinor fields (DHSF) as certain equivalence classes of even sections of the Cli?ord bundle. DHSF are then naturally identified with sections of a new bundle which we call the Spin-Cli?ord bundle. We discuss also the concept of amorphous spinor fields (ASF) – a name introduced by Crumeyrolle (1991). The so-called Dirac-K¨ahler spinors (K¨ahler, 1962) discussed by Graf (1978) and used in presentations of field theories in the lattice (Becher, 1981; Becher and Joos, 1982) are examples of ASF. We prove that they cannot be used to describe fermion fields because they cannot be used to properly formulate the Fierz identities. In Section 4 we show how the Cli?ord and Spin-Cli?ord bundle techniques permit us to give a simple presentation of the concept of covariant derivative for Cli?ord fields, algebraic Dirac Spinor Fields and for the DHSF. We show that our elegant theory agrees with the standard one developed for the so-called covariant Dirac spinor fields as developed, e.g., in (Lichnerowicz, 1964, 1984; Choquet-Bruhat et al., 1982). In Section 5 we introduce the concepts of Dirac and Spin-Dirac operators acting respectively on sections of the Cli?ord and Spin-Cli?ord bundles. We show how to use the Spin-Dirac operator on the representatives of DHSF on the Cli?ord bundle. In Section 6 we present the multiform derivative approach to Lagrangian field theory and derive the Dirac-Hestenes equation on a RCST (Choquet-Bruhat et al., 1982). We compare our results with some others that appear in the literature for the covariant Dirac Spinor field (Rodrigues et al., 1994; Hehl and Datta, 1971) and also for Dirac-K¨ahler fields (K¨ahler, 1962; Graf, 1978; Ivanenko and Obukhov, 1985). Finally in Section 7 we present our conclusion. 2. Covariant, Algebraic and Dirac-Hestenes Spinors 2.1. Some General Features about Clifford Algebras In this section we fix the notations to be used in this paper and introduce the main ideas concerning the theory of Cli?ord algebras necessary for the intelligibility of the paper. We follow with minor modifications the conventions used in (Rodrigues and Figueiredo, 1990; Lounesto, 1993). 3 Formal Definition of the Cli?ord Algebra Clscript (V,Q) Let K be a field, charK negationslash=2, 1 V a vector space of finite dimension n over K,and Q a nondegenerate quadratic form over V .Denoteby x·y = 1 2 (Q(x + y) ?Q(x) ? Q(y)) (1) the associated symmetric bilinear form on V and define the left contraction : logicalandtext V × logicalandtext V ? logicalandtext V and the right contraction : logicalandtext V × logicalandtext V ? logicalandtext V by the rules 1. x y = x·y x y = x·y 2. x (u ? v)=(x u)? v +ˆu ? (x v) (u ?v) x = u ?(v x)+(u x) ? ˆv 3. (u ?v) w = u (v w) u (v ? w)=(u v) w where x,y ? V , u,v,w ? logicalandtext V , and ˆ is the grade involution in the algebra logicalandtext V .The notation a· b will be used for contractions when it is clear from the context which factor is the contractor and which factor is being contracted. When just one of the factors is homogeneous, it is understood to be the contractor. When both factors are homogeneous, we agree that the one with lower degree is the contractor, so that for a ? logicalandtext r V and b ? logicalandtext s V ,wehavea·b = a b if r ? s and a·b = a b if r ? s. Define the (Cli?ord) product of x ? V and u ? logicalandtext V by xu = x?u + x u (2) and extend this product by linearity and associativity to all of logicalandtext V . This provides logicalandtext V with a new product, and provided with this new product logicalandtext V becomes isomor- phic to the Cli?ord algebra Clscript (V,Q). We recall that logicalandtext V = T(V )/I where T(V ) is the tensor algebra of V and I ? T(V ) is the bilateral ideal generated by the elements of the form x ?x, x ? V .It can also be shown that the Cli?ord algebra of (V,Q)isClscript (V,Q)=T(V )/I Q ,where I Q is the bilateral ideal generated by the elements of the form x?x?Q(x), x ? V . The Cli?ord algebra so constructed is an associative algebra with unity. Since K is a field, the space V is naturally embedded in Clscript (V,Q) V i arrowhookleft? T(V ) j ? T(V )/I Q = Clscript (V,Q) I Q = j ? i and V ? i Q (V ) ? Clscript (V,Q)(3) Let Clscript + (V,Q)[resp.,Clscript ? (V,Q)] be the j-image of ? ? i=0 T 2i (V )[resp.,? ? i=0 T 2i+1 (V )] in Clscript (V,Q). The elements of Clscript + (V,Q) form a sub-algebra of Clscript (V,Q) called the even sub-algebra of Clscript (V,Q). Clscript (V,Q) has the following property: If A is an associative K-algebra with unity then all linear mappings ? : V ? A such that (?(x)) 2 = Q(x), x ? V ,canbe extended in a unique way to an algebra homomorphism ? : Clscript (V,Q) ? A. In Clscript (V,Q) there exist three linear mappings which are quite natural. They are extensions of the mappings 1 In our applications in this paper, K will be IRorC, respectively the real or complex field. The quaternion ring will be denoted by IH. 4 Main involution: an automorphismˆ: Clscript (V,Q) ? Clscript (V,Q), extension of ? : V ? T(V )/I Q ,?(x)=?i Q (x)=?x, ?x ? V . Reversion: an anti-automorphism˜: Clscript (V,Q) ? Clscript (V,Q), extension of t : T r (V ) ? T r (V ); T r (V ) owner x = x i 1 ?...?x i r mapsto? x t = x i r ? ...?x i 1 . Conjugation: ¯: Clscript (V,Q) ? Clscript (V,Q), defined by the composition of the main involutionˆwith the reversion˜, i.e., if x ? Clscript (V,Q)thenx =(ˆx) ˜ =(˜x) ˆ . Clscript (V,Q) can be described through its generators, i.e., if ? = {E i } (i =1, 2,...,n) is a Q-orthonormal basis of V ,thenClscript (V,Q) is generated by 1 and the E i ’s are subjected to the conditions E i E i = Q(E i ) E i E j + E j E i =0,inegationslash= j; i,j =1, 2,...,n E 1 E 2 ···E n negationslash= ±1. (4) The Real Cli?ord Algebra Clscript p,q Let IR p,q be a real vector space of dimension n = p+q endowed with a nondegenerate metric g :IR p,q ×IR p,q ? IR . L e t ? = {E i },(i =1, 2,...,n) be an orthonormal basis of IR p,q , g(E i ,E j )=g ij = g ji = ? ? ? +1,i= j =1, 2,...p ?1,i= j = p +1,...,p+ q = n 0,inegationslash= j (5) The Cli?ord algebra Clscript p,q = Clscript (IR p,q ,Q) is the Cli?ord algebra over IR, generated by 1 and the {E i },(i =1, 2,...,n) such that E 2 i = Q(E i )=g(E i ,E i ), E i E j = ?E j E i (i negationslash= j), and (Ablamowicz et al., 1991) E 1 E 2 ...E n negationslash= ±1. Clscript p,q is obviously of dimension 2 n and as a vector space it is the direct sum of vector spaces logicalandtext k IR p,q of dimensions ( n k ), 0 ? k ? n. The canonical basis of logicalandtext k IR p,q is given by the elements e A = E ? 1 ...E ? k ,1? ? 1 < ... < ? k ? n. The element c J = E 1 ...E n ? logicalandtext n IR p,q commutes (n odd) or anticommutes (n even) with all vectors E 1 ,...,E n ? logicalandtext 1 IR p,q ? IR p,q . The center of Clscript p,q is logicalandtext 0 IR p,q ? IR i f n is even and its is the direct sum logicalandtext 0 IR p,q ? logicalandtext n IR p,q if n is odd. All Cli?ord algebras are semi-simple. If p + q = n is even, Clscript p,q is simple and if p + q = n is odd we have the following possibilities: 1. Clscript p,q is simple ? c 2 J = ?1 ? p ? q negationslash=1(mod4)? center of Clscript p,q is isomorphic to C 2. Clscript p,q is not simple (but is a direct sum of two simple algebras) ? c 2 J =+1? p ?q =1(mod4)? center of Clscript p,q is isomorphic to IR? IR . All these semi-simple algebras are direct sums of two simple algebras. If A is an associative algebra on the field K,K ? A,andifE is a vector space, a homomorphism ? from A to End E (End E is the endomorphism algebra of E) which maps the unit element of A to Id E is a called a representation of A in E. The dimension of E is called the degree of the representation. The addition in E together with the mapping A×E ? E,(a,x) mapsto? ?(a)x turns E in an A-module, the representation module. 5 Conversely, A being an algebra over K and E being an A-module, E is a vector space over K and if a ? A, the mapping ? : a ? ? a with ? a (x)=ax, x ? E,isa homomorphism A ? EndE, and so it is a representation of A in E. The study of A modules is then equivalent to the study of the representations of A. A representation ? is faithful if its kernel is zero, i.e., ?(a)x =0,?x ? E ? a =0.Thekernelof? is also known as the annihilator of its module. ? is said to be simple or irreducible if the only invariant subspaces of ?(a), ?a ? A,areE and {0}. Then the representation module is also simple, this meaning that it has no proper submodule. ? is said to be semi-simple, if it is the direct sum of simple modules, and in this case E is the direct sum of subspaces which are globally invariant under ?(a),?a ? A.When no confusion arises ?(a)x will be denoted by a • x, a x or ax.TwoA-modules E and E prime (with the exterior multiplication being denoted respectively by • and )are isomorphic if there exists a bijection ? : E ? E prime such that, ?(x + y)=?(x)+?(y), ?x, y ? E, ?(a • x)=a ?(x), ?a ? A, (6) and we say that representations ? and ? prime of A are equivalent if their modules are isomorphic. This implies the existence of a K-linear isomorphism ? : E ? E prime such that ? ? ?(a)=? prime (a) ? ?, ?a ? A or ? prime (a)=? ? ?(a) ? ? ?1 .IfdimE = n,then dimE prime = n. We shall need: Wedderburn Theorem. (Porteous, 1969)IfA is simple algebra then A is equiv- alent to F(m),whereF(m) is a matrix algebra with entries in F, F is a division algebra and m and F are unique (modulo isomorphisms). 2.2. Minimal Left Ideals of Clscript p,q The minimal left (resp., right) ideals of a semi-simple algebra A are of the type Ae (resp., eA), where e is a primitive idempotent of A, i.e., e 2 = e and e cannot be written as a sum of two non zero annihilating (or orthogonal) idempotents, i.e, e negationslash= e 1 + e 2 ,wheree 1 e 2 = e 2 e 1 =0,e 2 1 = e 1 , e 2 2 = e 2 . Theorem. The maximum number of pairwise annihilating idempotents in F(m) is m. The decomposition of Clscript p,q into minimal ideals is then characterized by a spectral set {e pq,i } of idempotents of Clscript p,q satisfying (i) summationtext i e pq,i = 1; (ii) e pq,i e pq,j = ? ij e pq,i ; (iii) rank of e pq,i is minimal negationslash= 0, i.e., e pq,i is primitive (i =1, 2,...,m) By rank of e pq,i we mean the rank of the logicalandtext IR p+q -morphism e pq,i : ? mapsto? ?e pq,i and logicalandtext IR p,q = ? n k=0 logicalandtext k (IR p,q ) is the exterior algebra of IR p,q .ThenClscript p,q = summationtext i I i p,q , I i p,q = Clscript p,q e pq,i and ? ? I i p,q is such that ?e pq,i = ?. Conversely any element ? ? I i p,q can be characterized by an idempotent e pq,i of minimal rank negationslash=0with ?e pq,i = ?. We have the following Theorem. (Lounesto, 1981) A minimal left ideal of Clscript p,q is of the type I p,q = Clscript p,q e pq where e pq = 1 2 (1 + e ? 1 )... 1 2 (1 + e ? k ) is a primitive idempotent of Clscript p,q and are e ? 1 ,...,e ? k commuting elements of the canonical basis of Clscript p,q such that (e ? i ) 2 =1, (i =1, 2,...,k) that generate a group of order 2 k , k = q ? r q?p and r i 
Fisica Preface to the Third and Preliminary Fourth Edition { Prelim. 4th edtn. (Feb 01): www.time-direction.de The third (1999) edition of the Direction of Time ofiered far more revisions and additions than the second one in 1992. During the seven years in between, several flelds of research related to the arrow of time had shown remarkable progress. For example, decoherence proved to be the most ubiquitous man- ifestation of the quantum arrow, while articles on various interpretations of quantum theory (many of them with inbuilt time-asymmetric dynamical aspects) can and do now regularly appear in reputed physics journals. There- fore, most parts of Chap. 4 were completely rewritten and some new sections added, while the second part of Chap. 3 was afiected by these changes in or- der to prepare for the discussion of measurements and dynamical maps within the framework of classical ensemble theory. However, all parts of the book have been revised, and some of them com- pletely rewritten, whilst essentially maintaining the book’s overall structure. Some of its new aspects may be listed here: The Introduction now attempts to distinguish rigorously between those time asymmetries which still preserve dynamical determinism, and the various ‘irreversiblities’ (arrows of time proper) which are the subject of this book. In Chap. 2, the concept of forks of causality is contrasted to that of forks of indeterminism (to be used in Chaps. 3 and 4), while the treatment of the radiation reaction of a moving charge (Sect. 2.3) had to be updated. Sects. 3.2{3.4 have been given a new structure, while a discussion of semi- groups and their physical meaning has been added to Sect. 3.4. In Chap. 4, only Sects. 4.1 and 4.5 (the former Sect. 4.3 on exponential decay) are not entirely new. In particular, there is now an extended separate Sect. 4.3 on decoherence. Sects. 4.4 (on quantum dynamical maps) and 4.6 (on the time arrow in various interpretations of quantum theory) is now added. In Chap. 5, the thermodynamics of acceleration is now presented separately (Sect. 5.2), while Sect. 5.3 on the expansion of the universe contains a discus- sion of the consistency of cosmic two-time boundary conditions. The dynam- ical interpretation of general relativity with its concept of intrinsic time is discussed in Sect. 5.4. Chap. 6 now covers all aspects of quantum cosmology and thus includes, as Sect. 6.1, the material of the former Sect. 5.2.2 on phase transitions of the vacuum with their consequences on entropy capacity. In Sect. 6.2 on quan- tum gravity, emphasis is on timelessness, which is enforced by quantization of a reparametrization invariant theory. There is a new Sect. 6.2.2 on the II Preface to the Third and Preliminary Fourth Edition { Prelim. 4th edtn. (Feb 01): www.time-direction.de emergence of classical time along the lines of the Tomonaga-Schwinger equa- tion, while Sect. 6.2.3 describes some speculations on the impact of quantum cosmology on the concept of black holes and their thermodynamical proper- ties. A numerical toy model has been appended after the Epilog in order to illustrate some typical arguments of stastistical mechanics. I also hope that most disadvantages which had resulted from the fact that I previously had (very unfortunately) translated many parts of the flrst edition from the German lecture notes that preceded it (Zeh 1984), have now been overcome. Two new books on the arrow of time (Price 1996 and Schulman 1997) have recently appeared. They are both well written, and they discuss many important aspects of ‘irreversible’ physics in a consistent and illuminating manner | often nicely complementing each other as well as this book. However, I difier from their views in two respects: I regard gravity (not least its quantized form) as basic for the arrow of time, as I try to explain in Chaps. 5 and 6, and I do not think that the problem of quantum measurements can be solved by means of an appropriate flnal condition in a satisfactory way (see Footnote 4 of Chap. 4). I wish to thank Julian Barbour, Erich Joos, Claus Kiefer, Joachim Kupsch, York Ramachers, Huw Price, Fritz Rohrlich, Paul Sheldon and Max Tegmark for their comments on early versions of various parts of the manu- script. Heidelberg, April 1999 H.-D. Zeh The fourth edition contains revisions throughout the whole book. There are many new formulations and arguments, several new comments and ref- erences, and three minor error corrections (on page 22, 112 and 146 of the third edition). It is now planned to be published in Spring 2001. Therefore, this preliminary internet version will not be further updated. For this edition I am grateful to David Atkinson (for a very helpful dis- cussion of radiation damping | Sect. 2.3), to Larry Schulman (for comments on the problem of simultaneous arrows of time | Sect. 3.1.2), and to Paul Sheldon (for a discussion of the compatibility of closed time-like curves with quantum theory | Chap. 1). The most e–cient help, this time, came from John Free, who carefully edited the whole book (not only for matters of English language). Heidelberg, February 2001 H.-D.

(Nov 00): www.time-direction.de The asymmetry of nature under a ‘reversal of time’ (that is, a reversal of mo- tion and change) appears only too obvious, as it deeply afiects our own form of existence. If physics is to justify the hypothesis that its laws control ev- erything that happens in nature, it should be able to explain (or consistently describe) this fundamental asymmetry which deflnes what may be called a direction in time or even | as will have to be discussed | a direction of time. Surprisingly, the very laws of nature are in pronounced contrast to this fundamental asymmetry: they are essentially symmetric under time reversal. It is this discrepancy that deflnes the enigma of the direction of time, while there is no lack of asymmetric formalisms or pictures that go beyond the empirical dynamical laws. It has indeed proven appropriate to divide the formal dynamical descrip- tion of nature into laws and initial conditions. Wigner (1972), in his Nobel Prize lecture, called it Newton’s greatest discovery, since it demonstrates that the laws by themselves are far from determining nature. The formulation of these two pieces of the dynamical description requires that appropriate kine- matical concepts (formal states or conflgurations z, say), which allow the unique mapping (or ‘representation’) of all possible states of physical sys- tems, have already been deflned on empirical grounds. For example, consider the mechanics of N mass points. Each state z is then equivalent to N points in three-dimensional space, which may be rep- resented in turn by their 3N coordinates with respect to a certain frame of reference. States of physical flelds are instead described by certain func- tions on three-dimensional space. If the laws of nature, in particular in their relativistic form, contain kinematical elements (that is, constraints for kine- matical concepts that would otherwise be too general), such as divB =0 in electrodynamics, one should distinguish them from the dynamical laws proper. This is only in formal contrast to relativistic spacetime symmetry (see Sect. 5.4). The laws of nature, thus reflned to their purely dynamical sense, describe the time dependence of physical states, z(t), in a general form | usually by means of difierential equations. They are called deterministic if they uniquely determine the state at time t from that (and possibly its time derivative) at any earlier or later time, that is, from an appropriate initial or flnal condition. This symmetric causal structure of dynamical determinism is stronger than the traditional concept of causality, which requires that every event in nature 
Fisica Discrete Quantum Electrodynamics Charles Francis Abstract:  The purpose of this paper is to construct a quantum field theory suitable for describing quantum electro- dynamics and Yang-Mills theory in a form which satisfies the conditions of the Millennium prize offered by the Clay Mathematics Institute as described by Jaffe and Witten [12], by showing that it satisfies ‘axioms at least as strong as those cited by’ Wightman [18] and by Osterwalder and Schrader [14], and by observing that this form of field theory has no mass gap. The definitions provide a model for relativistic quantum mechanics which supports a form of relativistic quantum field theory, but which does not depend on the sec- ond quantisation of a “matter wave”. Continuous laws of wave mechanics are found in model of discrete particle interactions which does not involve waves, or the quantisation of interacting fields. Newton’s first law and conservation of momentum are established from the principle of homogeneity. Maxwell’s equations are derived from the simple interaction in which a Dirac particle emits or absorbs a photon, showing that the renormalised mass and coupling constant are equal to their bare values. Feynman rules are calculated for the discrete theory and give the predictions of the standard renormalised theory. Quark confining inter- actions are described for qed and for an adaptation of Yang-Mills theory.  Charles Francis Clef Digital Systems Ltd. Lluest, Neuaddlwyd Lampeter Ceredigion  SA48 7RG 20/8/01 Discrete Quantum Electrodynamics 1 Background It has long been known that there is no finite unitary representation of the Lorentz group, and this paper seeks to resolve the problems in constructing field operators on covariant Hilbert space by defining equiv- alence classes of operators on an infinite family of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Lorentz transformation will invoke a different Hilbert space on which the transformed field operator is unambiguously defined. A lattice is used to define the basis for each Hilbert space, but there are important differences between discrete quantum field theory as described here and, e.g. lattice quantum field theory as developed by Wilson and others and described by e.g. Montvay & Münster [13]. The physical structure to which this mathematical model relates is also described using an “information space” interpretation in which reality exists but quan- tum mechanics describes the information we have about it. The reader should distinguish interpretation from the mathematical construction based on the given definitions which is the subject of this paper, but interpre- tation is necessary because the mathematical structure applies to each observer’s information space while it could not apply to ontological space-time, and to avoid confusion with interpretational remarks found in other treatments which cannot be applied here. The interpretation is orthodox, being based on Heisenberg’s discussion of the Copenhagen interpretation in [9] and the Dirac-Von Neumann approach to it [10][2]. It does not use Bohr’s complementary, Jordan’s second quantisation of ‘matter fields’, nor have a dependency on a classical Lagrangian or action principle. Commutation relations are found from the definition of momentum states as linear combinations of position states, not simply imposed by canonical quantisation. As distinct from lattice qed, discrete qed uses Minkowsky rather than Euclidean co-ordinates, and uses a bounded momentum space with an automatic cut-off. An energy cut-off follows from the mass shell condi- tion, but there is no cut-off in the off mass shell energy which appears in the perturbation expansion, since this is an abstract parameter in a contour integral (section 18). A discrete model cannot be manifestly cov- ariant. Manifest covariance is not necessary since the lattice is not physical and is observer dependent. It is required that the laws of physics are the same in all reference frames, and covariance is redefined to allow an invariant hermitian product on a space of covariant functions. Points in one observer’s information space do not transform to those in another’s and operators for position in different reference frames do not com- mute. Classical vector observables exist on a scale where the lattice appears as a continuum. This scale appears many orders of magnitude smaller than experimental errors. Manifest covariance and the renormal- ised formulae of the standard model are recovered on letting lattice size go to infinity and lattice spacing go to zero. The Landau pole appears in this limit but only after reordering series where we do not have absolute convergence and does not indicate anything more serious than the breakdown of an iterative solution to a non-perturbative equation. In fact the Landau pole does not appear if lattice spacing is bounded below by a fundamental interval of proper time in the interactions between particles, and it is suggested that this is in fact the case in a subsequent paper [7], where a minimum proper time between interactions is related to uni- fication with gravity.  Using finite dimensional space the definition of linear field operators is unproblematic, as they are oper- ators, not operator valued distributions. The field operators constructed here will be used to describe interactions between particles using the interaction picture. Although formally similar to quantised free fields, they will be used to describe the potential for the creation or annihilation of a particle in an interac- Discrete Quantum Electrodynamics 2 tion. This cannot be reconciled to interpretational statements which are sometimes made about models which arise from the quantisation of classical fields, such as “The free field describes particles which do not interact” (Glimm & Jaffe p 100 [8]); it will be appreciated that while the formulae of the present construc- tion are extremely like the formulae which arise in such models and give the same physical predictions in the appropriate limits, the meaning of these formulae is quite different. Although apparently innocuous, perhaps the most significant mathematical difference between this and other formulations of field theory is that time is a parameter, as in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, and each Hilbert space  is formulated for synchronous states at time t. The U-matrix is strictly a map  where , so that unitarity does not apply (conservation of probability is required). Homomorphically identifying  introduces what has perhaps been the central problem in the construction of quantum field theory in 4 dimensions, namely the indefinability of the equal point multiplication between the field operators (which is definable but would invalidate the limit as lattice spacing goes to zero). This is resolved pragmatically by normal ordering all equal point multiplications of field operators. ?his non-linear condition is motivated physically by saying that a particle created at  can- not interact again at the same instant. This has an important effect upon renormalisation and gives physical motivation to the method of Epstein & Glaser [17][5] in which  is replaced with a con- tinuous switching function which is zero at , removing loop divergences. The analysis of the origin of the ultraviolet divergence is, for practical purposes, that given by Scharf [17], namely the incorrect use of Wick’s theorem. The difference between this treatment and Scharf is that here the limiting procedure uses a discrete sum whereas Epstein and Glaser use a continuous switching function, and while Scharf says (p163) “the switching on and off the interaction is unphysical”, here the switching off and on of the interac- tion at  is a physical constraint meaning that only one interaction takes place for each particle in any instant, i.e. that the interaction operator at time t cannot act on the result of itself. In practice this is done by normal ordering all equal time products of fields. Thus an annihilation operator at time t does not act on a creation operator at the same time. As with the method of Epstein & Glaser, this leads directly to a pertur- bation expansion in which the terms are finite and similar in form to the standard “renormalised” expansion. Thus we will state that the correct description of physical processes in qft uses an interaction Hamiltonian  such that .  is not a linear operator so we do not have . In other respects H is much as in ordinary qed. Unitarity does not apply to non-linear operators, and it will be shown that H pre- serves the norm as required by conservation of probability. Linearity of time evolution is required to avoid a dependency on histories; the interactions of a particle created yesterday should be no different from those of one created the day before. Despite the apparently radical nature of non-linearity it will be seen that the time evolution proposed here is linear for states created in the past, and only distinguishes the interaction of a particle created “now” from those of particles created “not now”. It will be clear from the use of families of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces that the present construction does not obey the Wightman axioms, which specify a single covariant Hilbert space. It will be clear once transformations between observer dependent Hilbert spaces have been specified, and field operators have been defined on such Hilbert spaces, that the model obeys axioms at least as strong as those cited by Wight- man [18] and by Osterwalder and Schrader [14]. It is immediate that the algebras of operators defined by 15.18 for the photon, and by 16.1 together with 16.5 and 16.8 for the Dirac field obey the Haag-Kastler axi- oms given in [8] after redefining the Lorentz group as specified in section 8.

The existence of a mass gap is equivalent to the statement that the model has no zero mass particles. The model allows a zero mass neutrino (even if there is not one in nature), and since photons, and other inter- mediate vector bosons such as the gluon, are here treated as particles on an equal footing with fermions, it is obvious that this model has no mass gap. Indeed there will always be eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian con- taining an indefinite number of photons at an energy threshold below that for particle creation. Naturally if a massive particle is present, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian will always be above that mass. 2  Information Space  It is important to distinguish the definitional properties of information space from postulates about the behaviour of matter. We make no assumption of an ontological background in which matter is placed and define a reference frame as the set of potential results of measurement of position. In this view geometry is simply and literally world (geo-) measurement (-metry); to understand geometry we must study how observ- ers measure space-time co-ordinates. Each observer has a clock, which is, without loss of generality, the origin of his co-ordinate system and measures proper time for that observer. Each event is given a co-ordi- nate by measuring the time taken for light to travel to and fro the event. Now suppose there is some fundamental minimum unit of time. Then the measured co-ordinates are integer multiples of that unit and the co-ordinate system is a lattice consisting of measured events and potential measured events in discrete multiples of that unit, bounded by the time period in which the observer carries out measurements. Thus each observer’s reference frame is defined as a lattice determined by the finite resolution with which it is possible to measure time; it is part of information space of a particular observer, not prior ontology. For sim- plicity we will use a cubical lattice, although any lattice can be used as appropriate to the measuring apparatus and chosen co-ordinate system of an individual observer. The notion that space-time appears not as an invariant background but as an observer dependent set of potential measurement results, is in strictly accordance with the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics. In Dirac’s words “In the general case we cannot speak of an observable having a value for a particular state, but we can .... speak of the probability of its having a specified value for the state, meaning the probability of this specified value being obtained when one makes a measurement of the observable” [3]. When this statement is applied to the position observable, it follows that position exists only in meas- urement of position, and not as part of background geometry.  The measurement of time and position is sufficient for the study of many (it has been suggested all) other physical quantities; for example a classical measurement of velocity may be reduced to a time trial over a measured distance, and a typical measurement of momentum of a particle involves plotting its path in a bub- ble chamber. In practice there is also a bound on the magnitude of the result, and we take the results of measurement of position to be in a finite region , in units of lattice spacing, ?. Without loss of gen- erality define  Definition: The coordinate system is  for some , where . ? 0 3 ? ??– ?,(]?– ?,(]?– ?,(]0 3 ???=?0? ?– ?,(]x 0 ?– x ??<?{}= Discrete Quantum Electrodynamics 4 There is no significance in the bound, ?, of a given co-ordinate system ?. If matter goes outside of N it is merely moving out of a co-ordinate system, not out of the universe. Generally it is possible to describe its motion in another co-ordinate system with another origin. Even if we do not intend to take the limit , ? may chosen large enough to say with certainty up to the limit of experimental accuracy, that it contains any particle under study for the duration of the experiment. We ignore matter outside of ? and impose con- servation of probability as usual.  Definition: Let 0ý be the set of finite discrete coordinate systems of sufficient size to include all particles under study which can be defined by an observer by means of physical measurement. 0  includes curvilin- ear as well as rectangular coordinates. The intention is to compose a manifold out of the collection of such co-ordinate systems. In general this will require non-Euclidean metric [7], but for the purpose of this paper, co-ordinate systems in 0  will be defined using a flat metric, and will be regarded as defining a tangent space. We will not here study the con- nection between coordinate systems with different origins, but merely note the intention that this model be compatible with any Lorentzian manifold. Definition: For any point  is the ket corresponding to a measurement of position with result x.  is called a position ket. Definition: Let  be the empty ket or the vacuum state, a name for a state of no particles.  In the absence of information, we cannot describe the actual configuration of particles; kets are names or labels for states, not descriptions of matter. The significance is that the principle of superposition will be introduced as a definitional truism in a naming system, not as a physical assumption. Although kets are not states, but merely names for states, we loosely refer to kets as states in keeping with common practice when no ambiguity arises. In a typical measurement in quantum mechanics we study a particle in near isolation. The suggestion is that there are too few ontological relationships to generate the property of position. Then position does not exist prior to the measurement, and the measurement itself is responsible for introducing interactions which generate position. In this case, prior to the measurement, the state of the system is not labelled by a position ket, and we define labels containing information about other states – namely the infor- mation about what would happen in a measurement. In scientific measurement we set up many repetitions of a system, and record the frequency of each result. Probability is interpreted here simply as a prediction of a frequency distribution, so a mathematical model must associate a probability with each possible result. The probability of a given result can be used to attach a label to the state in the following way:  Definition: Let  Definition: Construct a vector space, *, over %, with basis * 0 .

Fisica Dissipation and Controlled Euler-Poincar´e Systems C. A. Woolsey 1 , A. M. Bloch 2 , N. E. Leonard 3 , J. E. Marsden 4 1 Aerospace & Ocean Engineering Virginia Tech Blacksburg, VA 24061 cwoolsey@vt.edu 3 Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Princeton University Princeton, NJ 08544 naomi@princeton.edu 2 Dept. of Mathematics University of Michigan Ann Arbor, MI 48109 abloch@math.lsa.umich.edu 4 Control & Dynamical Systems California Institute of Technology 107-81 Pasadena, CA 91125 marsden@cds.caltech.edu Abstract The method of controlled Lagrangians is a tech- nique for stabilizing underactuated mechanical systems which involves modifying a system’s en- ergy and dynamic structure through feedback. These modifications can obscure the e?ect of phys- ical dissipation in the closed-loop. For example, generic damping can destabilize an equilibrium which is closed-loop stable for a conservative sys- tem model. In this paper, we consider the ef- fect of damping on Euler-Poincar´e (special reduced Lagrangian) systems which have been stabilized about an equilibrium using the method of con- trolled Lagrangians. We describe a choice of feed- back dissipation which asymptotically stabilizes a sub-class of controlled Euler-Poincar´e systems sub- ject to physical damping. As an example, we con- sider intermediate axis rotation of a damped rigid body with a single internal rotor. 1 Introduction The method of controlled Lagrangians [6, 3] was specialized to the problem of stabilizing equilibria for Euler-Poincar´e systems in [7]. A feedback con- trol law was proposed which preserves the Euler- Poincar´e structure but which shapes the kinetic energy of the closed-loop system. More generally, one may choose feedback which also modifies the dynamic structure [4]. Closed-loop stability can be studied using Lyapunov methods. This paper describes the e?ect of external damping on an Euler-Poincar´e system which has been stabi- lized using the method of controlled Lagrangians. Left uncompensated, generic damping may desta- bilize the closed-loop equilibrium. We propose a technique for choosing feedback dissipation which yields asymptotic stability for a sub-class of con- trolled Euler-Poincar´e systems. The approach in- volves the construction and analysis of a semidefi- nite Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system. This work builds on previous results for the under- water vehicle with internal rotors [10, 11]. In addition to the previous work of the authors the idea of kinetic energy shaping has been pursued in the Lagrangian setting in [1, 8]. The method of interconnection and damping assignment [2, 9] is an equivalent approach in the Hamiltonian setting [4]. The Hamiltonian approach was also used in the earlier paper [5, 10, 11]. 2 Review The systems considered here have as their config- uration space a product of Lie groups Q = H ×G where H is non-abelian and G is Abelian. The dynamics are invariant under the left action of H, the Lagrangian is cyclic in the G-variables, and the control enters in the G-direction [7]. Assuming the control is chosen to preserve the H-symmetry, the dynamics may be described in a reduced velocity phase space isomorphic to h × G, where h is the Lie algebra of H. Let ? ? represent an element of h and let ? a represent an element of G. The reduced Lagrangian has the form l(? ? , ? ? a )= 1 2 g ?? ? ? ? ? + g ?b ? ? ? ? b + 1 2 g ab ? ? a ? ? b , where g ?? , g ?b , and g ab are the (constant) com- ponents of the local kinetic energy metric. In the absence of generalized forces other than the con- trol, the open-loop equations are d dt ?l ?? ? = c ? ?? ? ? ?l ?? ? (1) d dt ?l ? ? ? a = u a . (2) The coe?cients c ? ?? are structure constants for h. Let M ? represent the momentum conjugate to ? ? , M ? = ?l ?? ? . In examples, M ? typically represents the total sys- tem momentum. In the Lagrangian setting, a Casimir C k (M ? ) satisfies d dt C k = ?C k ?M ? parenleftbigg c ? ?? ? ? ?l ?? ? parenrightbigg =0. Physically, Casimirs often correspond to conserva- tion laws for total inertial momentum. For the system described by (1) and (2), the functions C k are conserved for any choice of control; this obser- vation relates to the fact that internal actuators cannot a?ect total inertial momentum. We wish to stabilize an unstable equilibrium (? ? , ? ? a )| e =(? ? e , 0) (3) of the uncontrolled dynamics (1) and (2). (This equilibrium corresponds to a relative equilibrium for the unreduced system.) The method of con- trolled Lagrangians provides a control-modified re- duced Lagrangian l c . Under certain conditions on the parameters defining l c , and for a particular control law u a , the closed-loop dynamics are d dt ?l c ?? ? = c ? ?? ? ? ?l c ?? ? (4) d dt ?l c ? ? ? a =0. (5) Lyapunov stability analysis gives conditions on control gains for closed-loop stability of (3). Choosing the modified energy such that ?l ?? ? = ?l c ?? ? , leads to “matching” of equations (1) and (4). The Euler-Poincar´e matching conditions [7] lead to the controlled Lagrangian l c (? ? , ? ? a )= 1 2 g ?? ? ? ? ? + g ?b ? ? ? ? b + 1 2 ? ab ? ? a ? ? b where ? ab is a constant control parameter. To state the control law, we first define B ?? = g ?? ? g ?a g ab g b? , D ab = g ab +(g ac ? ? ac )g c? B ?? g ?e g eb , k ? a = D ab (g bc ? ? bc )g c? B ?? . By convention, g ab denotes the inverse of g ab . The control law which gives the closed-loop equa- tions (4) and (5) is u a = k ? a parenleftbigg d dt ?l ?? ? parenrightbigg = k ? a c ? ?? ? ? ?l ?? ? . (6) Note that the coe?cient k ? a depends on the control parameter ? ab . Choosing u a as in (6) gives the closed-loop equations (4) and (5). Define the controlled momenta ˜ J a = ?l c ? ? ? a = g a? ? ? + ? ab ? ? b ˜ M ? = ?l c ?? ? = A ?? ? ? + g ?a ? ab ˜ J b where A ?? = g ?? ? g ?a ? ab g b? . Written in terms of ? ? and ˜ J a , the controlled en- ergy takes the block diagonal form E c (? ? , ˜ J a )= 1 2 A ?? ? ? ? ? + 1 2 ? ab ˜ J a ˜ J b . (7) This form is useful for studying stability of relative equilibria, as described in Section 3. 3 Including Generalized Forces Assume that the control law u a has been chosen according to (6). Furthermore, assume that there is a function E ?,? (? ? , ˜ J a )= 1 2 A ?? ? ? ? ? + 1 2 ? ab ˜ J a ˜ J b +?(C k )+?( ˜ J a ). (8) which has a minimum or a maximum at the desired equilibrium (3). One method for generating such a function is the energy-Casimir method, which im- poses conditions on the control gains and on the equilibrium values of the first and second partial derivatives of ? and ?. The conditions on the first derivatives ensure that the equilibrium is a criti- cal point of E ?,? . The conditions on the second derivatives ensure that the equilibrium is a strict minimum or maximum. Simple candidates for ? and ? are functions which are linear and quadratic in their arguments. We let ?(C k )=? k C k + ? kl 2 (C k ? C k e )(C l ? C l e ) (9) and ?( ˜ J a )= 1 2? ? ab ˜ J a ˜ J b , (10) where the scalar constants ? k ,? kl , and ? are chosen to satisfy conditions imposed during the energy-Casimir stability analysis. (Note: If ? ?| e negationslash= 0, then ? must include a linear term.) In the absence of damping, the controlled energy E c , the Casimirs C k , and the controlled momenta ˜ J a are all conserved. Thus d dt E ?,? = 0 and Lya- punov stability follows immediately. More gener- ally, suppose the system is subject to generalized forces F ? and F a , so that d dt ?l ?? ? = c ? ?? ? ? ?l ?? ? + F ? (11) d dt ?l ? ? ? a = u a + F a . (12) One may consider F ? as “external” forces and F a as “internal” forces. In general, the internal forces F a destroy conservation of E c and ˜ J a . These forces do not a?ect the total momentum ˜ M ? = M ? , so the Casimirs C k are una?ected. The external forces F ? typically destroy all conservation laws. One can show that d dt E ?,? = A ?? ? ? ?? ? + ? ab ˜ J a ? ˜ J b + ?? ?C k ?C k ? ˜ M ? ? ˜ M ? + ?? ? ˜ J a ? ˜ J a = parenleftBigg ? ? A ?? B ?? + ?? ?C k ?C k ? ˜ M ? parenrightBigg F ? ? ? ? g ?a D ab F b + parenleftbigg 1+ 1 ? parenrightbigg ˜ J a D ab parenleftBig F b ? k ? b F ? parenrightBig . (13) If F ? = 0, equation (13) suggests a choice of feed- back dissipation F a that will drive the modified energy to its minimum or maximum value [7]. Un- fortunately, E ?,? is not generally suitable as a Lyapunov function when F ? negationslash= 0. The quadratic terms in (9) can make d dt E ?,? indefinite, regardless of the choice of feedback dissipation. By omitting the quadratic terms from ?(C k ), one might obtain a semidefinite function whose rate could be made semidefinite, with opposite sign, by an appropriate choice of feedback dissipation. Stability could then be studied using LaSalle’s invariance principle. Assumption 3.1 The truncated function E ¯ ?,? = 1 2 A ?? ? ? ? ? + 1 2 ? ab ˜ J a ˜ J b + ? k C k +?( ˜ J a ) has a (non-strict) minimum or maximum at the desired equilibrium (3). Assumption 3.1 is somewhat restrictive, although it holds for many interesting examples. Suppose the external force F ? represents physical damping, with a thrust term to balance damping at the desired equilibrium. For simplicity, we as- sume that the damping is linear in velocity and that any internal damping is cancelled through feedback: d dt ?l ?? ? = c ? ?? ? ? ?l ?? ? ? d ?? (? ? ? ? ? e ) d dt ?l ? ? ? a = u a , where d ?? is a positive definite tensor. Though we assume linear damping, the results should hold for more general drag models, provided these models reflect some basic properties of physical dissipation (e.g., that drag “opposes velocity”). Under the following assumption, d dt E ¯ ?,? given by (13) (with ? replaced by ¯ ?) can be made quadratic in ? ? and ˜ J a through dissipative feedback. Assumption 3.2 C k = 1 2 h k?? ˜ M ? ˜ M ? (14) where h k?? is constant and symmetric in ?,?. We note that Casimirs for a number of physically interesting systems, including the free rigid body, the heavy top, and the underwater vehicle, can be expressed as quadratic forms. Substituting the dissipation model and equation (14) into (13) gives d dt E ¯ ?,? = parenleftbigg ?g ?a ? ? + parenleftbigg 1+ 1 ? parenrightbigg ˜ J a parenrightbigg D ab F b ? ˜ J a X a? d ?? (? ? ? ? ? e ) ? ? ? Y ? ? d ??

(16) Assumption 3.3 d ?? ? ? e is in the null space of X a? and Y ? ? . Assumption (3.3) implies that d dt E ¯ ?,? is indefinite in the direction of the propulsive force. Theorem 3.4 The feedback dissipation F a = D ab ˜ d bc parenleftbigg ?g c? ? ? + parenleftbigg 1+ 1 ? parenrightbigg ˜ J c parenrightbigg , (17) with ˜ d ab symmetric and negative (positive) defi- nite, makes d dt E ¯ ?,? ?

X a? g a? + g ?b X b? d ?? parenrightBig +2g ?a ˜ d ab g b? ? (?)0. The proof follows from linear algebra. Having found feedback dissipation which makes d dt E ¯ ?,? ? (?)0, one may conclude that the positive (nega- tive) semidefinite function E¯ ?,? approaches a con- stant value. LaSalle’s invariance principle can be used to show asymptotic stability. 4 Example The problem of stabilizing steady intermediate axis rotation of a rigid body with a single internal rotor using the method of controlled Lagrangians is discussed in [7] and references therein (see also [5]). Let I i represent the rigid body principal moments of inertia (i =1,2,3), let J 1 = J 2 and J 3 represent the rotor principal moments of inertia, and define ? i = I i + J i . We assume that ? 1 >? 2 >? 3 . Let ? =(? 1 , ? 2 ,? 3 ) T be the angular velocity of the carrier and let ? be the relative angle of the inter- nal rotor about its spin axis, the body 3-axis. The reduced Lagrangian is the total kinetic energy: l(?, ? ?)= 1 2 parenleftBig ? 1 ? 2 1 + ? 2 ? 2 2 + I 3 ? 2 3 + J 3 (? 3 + ? ?) 2 parenrightBig . With a control torque u acting on the internal ro- tor, the equations of motion are d dt ?l ?? = ??× ?l ?? d dt ?l ? ? ? = u. The square magnitude of total angular momen- tum, C = 1 2 bardbl ?l ?? bardbl 2 , is a Casimir for the system. Let [? ab ]=?J 3 where ? is a dimensionless scalar. (Square brackets denote the matrix form of a ten- sor.) Applying the control law u = u cL with u cL = parenleftbigg 1+ ? ? ? 1 I 3 J 3 parenrightbigg ?1 (? 1 ? ? 2 )? 1 ? 2 (18) yields the closed-loop equations d dt ?l c ?? = ??× ?l c ?? d dt ?l c ? ? ? =0, where the controlled Lagrangian is l c (?, ? ?)= 1 2 parenleftbig ? 1 ? 2 1 + ? 2 ? 2 2 + I 3 ? 2 3 parenrightbig + J 3 ? 3 ? ? + 1 2 ?J 3 ? ? 2 . The momentum conjugate to ? is the controlled conserved quantity ˜ l 3 = J 3 (? 3 + ? ? ?). Define the “controlled inertia” I C 3 = I 3 + ? ? 1 ? J 3 . For this example, [A ?? ] = diag(? 1 ,? 2 ,I C 3 ) and, referring to equation (7), the controlled energy is E c (?, ˜ l 3 )= 1 2 parenleftBigg ? 1 ? 2 1 + ? 2 ? 2 2 + I C 3 ? 2 3 + ˜ l 2 3 ?J 3 parenrightBigg . The equilibrium ? e =[0, ¯ ?, 0] T , ? ? e =0, (19) with ¯ ? negationslash= 0, corresponds to steady rotation about the intermediate axis with zero relative rotor ve- locity. This equilibrium is unstable for the uncon- trolled system. The control law (18) can be shown to stabilize (19) for appropriate choices of ?. Con- ditions on ? for stability may be found by applying the energy-Casimir method to E ?,? (?, ˜ l 3 )=E c (?, ˜ l 3 )+?(C)+?( ˜ l 3 ). In the absence of dissipation, a su?cient condition for nonlinear stability is [7] 0 <?< J 3 J 3 + I 3 . (20) In this case, a negative definite Lyapunov function for (19) is E ?,? = E c ? 1 ? 2 C + ? 11 2 (C ? C e ) 2 + ˜ l 2 3 2??J 3 , where the constant ? 11 < 0 and ? satisfies parenleftbigg 1+ 1 ? parenrightbigg < J 3 ? (? 2 ? I C 3 ) . An appropriate choice of feedback dissipation leads to asymptotic stability [7]. Assume that the rigid body is subject to an external torque ?D(? ? ? e ) where D = diag(d 1 ,d 2 ,d 3 ) > 0, d dt ?l ?? = ??× ?l ?? ?D(??? e ) d dt ?l ? ? ? = u. Choose the new control law u = u cL + u diss (21) where u cL is given by (18) and u diss is a dissipative feedback term to be chosen. To illustrate that d dt E ?,? is indefinite, assume that at an instant ? 1 =? 3 = 0 and ˜ l 3 = 0. At that instant, regardless of the choice of u diss , d dt E ?,? = ? 11 (C ? C e )(? 2 ? 2 )(?d 2 (? 2 ? ¯ ?)). Since (C ? C e )(? 2 ? ¯ ?) > 0 at this instant, the sign of d dt E ?,? depends on ? 2 . Thus, E ?,? cannot be a Lyapunov function. Instead, we consider the negative semidefinite function E ¯ ?,? = E c ? 1 ? 2 C + ˜ l 2 3 2??J 3 and apply the procedure outlined in Section 3. In accordance with Assumption 3.2, we may write C as a quadratic form where [h 1?? ] is the 3×3 iden- tity matrix. One may verify that Assumption 3.3 is satisfied by computing X a? and Y ? ? according to definitions (15) and (16). Define the dissipative feedback gain [ ˜ d ab ]=J 3 / ˜ d, where ˜ d is a scalar parameter, and choose u diss = [F a ] given in equation (17). Applying Theorem 3.4, one finds that choosing ? to satisfy 0 < 1+ 1 ? < min parenleftbigg ? I 3 (? ? 1)? 2 , J 3 ? (? 2 ? I C 3 ) parenrightbigg (22) and choosing ˜ d = d 3 parenleftBig ?+1 ??? 2 + ??1 ? 1 I 3 parenrightBig 2 parenleftBigg ?

LaSalle’s invariance principle applies to systems with semidefinite Lyapunov functions, although the task of finding a trapping region is not triv- ial. For this example, one may find a trapping region using a physical argument. Since drag in- creases with angular velocity and the propulsive 
Fisica Distance function wavelets – Part I: Helmholtz and convection-diffusion  transforms and series     W. Chen  Simula Research Laboratory, P. O. Box. 134, 1325 Lysaker, Norway  E-mail: wenc@simula.no   (9 May 2002)    Summary    This report aims to present my research updates on distance function wavelets (DFW)  based on the fundamental solutions and general solutions of the Helmholtz, modified  Helmholtz, and convection-diffusion equations, which include the isotropic Helmholtz- Fourier (HF) transform and series, the Helmholtz-Laplace (HL) transform, and the  anisotropic convection-diffusion wavelets and ridgelets. The latter is set to handle  discontinuous and track data problems. The edge effect of the HF series is addressed.  Alternative existence conditions for the DFW transforms are proposed and discussed. To  simplify and streamline the expression of the HF and HL transforms, a new dimension- dependent function notation is introduced. The HF series is also used to evaluate the  analytical solutions of linear diffusion problems of arbitrary dimensionality and  geometry. The weakness of this report is lacking of rigorous mathematical analysis due to  the author’s limited mathematical knowledge.     Keywords: Helmholtz-Fourier transform and series, Helmholtz-Laplace transform,  distance function, radial basis function, distance function wavelet, ridgelets, Helmholtz  equation, modified Helmholtz equation, convection-diffusion equation, fundamental  solution, general solution, edge effect.         1 1. Introduction    This report is the first in series [1,2] about my latest advances on the distance function  wavelets (DFW) using the fundamental solution and general solution of partial  differential equations (PDEs). It is well known that the Helmholtz and modified  Helmholtz equations are of vital importance in many basic and applied fields. In  particular, it is worth pointing out that the omnipresent Fourier analysis and Laplace  transform have their origin from the solution of the 1D Helmholtz equations [3,4]. The  DFW’s based on the solutions of Helmholtz equations could be understood a  generalization of the formers via the distance variable instead of coordinate variables.  This report focuses on the Helmholtz-Fourier (HF) transform and series and the  Helmholtz-Laplace (HL) transform, respectively corresponding to the Helmholtz  equation and the modified Helmholtz equation. Serving as an illustration of their  applications, the HF series is employed to get the analytical solutions of the linear  diffusion equations of arbitrary dimensionality and geometry [5]. Furthermore, the  anisotropic DFW using the solution of the convection-diffusion equation is proposed to  handle discontinuous and track data problems. The underlying connection between such  anisotropic DFW and ridgelets is also discussed. The present wavelet transform and  series differ from the standard wavelets in that they use the solution of PDEs as do the  Fourier and Laplace analyses. The DFW’s could be of widespread use in handling  multiscale multivariate scattered data and PDEs. This report is based on the author’s  recent works [5-7] as well as some newly-discovered important references on radial  wavelets [8-11] and the Laplacian Green function wavelets [12]. The readers are also  advised to find the motivations behind developing DFW via the solutions of PDEs from  [5-7].     In what follows, the section 2 briefly discusses the differences between the basic concepts  of coordinate variable, distance variable, radial function, radial basis function (RBF) and  distance function as well as the fundamental solution, the general solution and Green  function of PDEs. Refs. 8-12 are critically discussed. Afterwards, the readers will  understand why this report uses the term “distance function” instead of common “radial   2 basis function”. Section 3 proposes and discusses alternative existence conditions for the  DFW transform, and then, the HF and HL transforms and series are developed and the  notorious edge effect of the Fourier series and the HF series is also addressed. An  alternative dimension-dependent function representation of the solutions of the  Helmholtz equations is also presented to simplify and streamline the expression of the HF  and HL transforms. In section 4, the HF series is used to evaluate the analytical solutions  of the linear diffusion problems of any dimensions and geometry. In section 5, the  anisotropic distance function wavelets and ridgelets using the solution of convection- diffusion equation are proposed. Finally, some remarks are made in section 6 based on  the results reported here.      2. Coordinate variable and distance variable, radial function, radial basis  function and distance function    Scientific and engineering communities alike have long gotten used to expressing  mathematical physics problems in terms of coordinate variables. As an alternative in  many cases, the problem functions can also be represented via the distance variable. To  many, this may be a quite exotic approach in dealing with practical analysis and  computations. However, if one recalls the Newtonian gravitation potential formula, it is  immediately clear that what essentially matters is a distance variable rather than location  variables. In fact, describing physics problems in terms of distance functions is a truly  physical approach on the ground of potential (field) theory, or in mathematical  terminology, distribution theory [13]. In multivariate scattered data processing, now the  distance function approach has become the method of the choice [14].     The function expressed in the Euclidean distance variable is usually termed as the radial  basis function in literature. This is due to the fact that all such RBFs are radially isotropic  due to the rotational invariant, and have become de facto the conventional distance  function of the widest use today. However, there do exist quite some important  anisotropic “RBFs”. For instance, the spherical “radial basis function” in handling   3 geodesic problem [15] and so-called time-space “RBFs” [16]. The present author [17]  also developed some anisotropic kernel distance functions using the solutions of PDEs,  termed as the kernel “RBF” there, such as kernel space-time “RBF”, and those relating to  the convection-diffusion equation, where the dot product of differences of pairs  coordinate variables and velocity vector appear along with the Euclidean distance  variable on the ground of translation invariant. For details see later section 5. It is obvious  that all these so-called anisotropic “RBFs” are not radially isotropic. In general, we have  distance functions using three kinds of distance variables [18,19]:   1. () ( k xxxf ?= ? ), rotational invariant,  2. () ( ) k xxxf ?= ? , translation invariant,  3. () ( ) k xxxf ?= ? , ridge function, where dot denotes a scalar product of two vectors.  It is obvious that the rotational invariant “RBF” does not cover the latter two. In most  literature, the term “RBF” is, however, often simply used indiscriminatingly for the  rotational and translation invariants distance variables and functions. Thus, the term  “radial basis function” is really a misnomer in referring to general distance functions and  their applications. The very basic merit of the distance function is to handle all kinds of  irregular data and PDEs problems with complicated domain. The conventional use of the  RBF instead of general distance function may unnecessarily confuse the nascent  researchers with an implication of narrowly-defined rotational invariant problems under a  radially symmetric domain. Searching internet via the Yahoo, I found more than 14,100  links with the “distance function” compared with 11,200 with the “radial basis function”  and zero with “distance basis function”. Based on the mathematical consistency and  down-to-earth convention, this study used the term “distance function” instead of the  radial basis function in general.     Next comes a discussion of a RBF-associated concept of radial function. As stated in  [20], a radial function is any functions of the form (x? ) , where ?  is the Euclidean  norm and ? is any real-valued function defined on . In comparison, the radial basis  function is a shifted radial function of form  [ )?,0 ( k x? )x? , where x k  is a specified point in  IR n . Such a conceptual nuance makes the RBF very flexible for irregular data and   4 arbitrarily complicated domain problems due to the distribution theory. Refs. [8-11]  develop the radial function wavelets (RFW) based on the solution of the Bessel equation,  where the radial function is connected to spherically symmetric problems. The work is a  rare case where the solution of an ordinary differential equation is applied as the wavelet  basis function. This RFW [8-11] and the real HF J transform, one of the present DFW’s   to be introduced later, are found very similar in their use of the wavelet basis function  and corresponding admissible condition. But these similarities should not be allowed to  veil some fundamental differences between the RFW and the DFW’s. Firstly, that RFW  is not inductive to being used for irregular bounded domain and scattered data problems  as the RBF wavelets [5-7], let alone more general DFW. One very basic distinction lies in  that the DFW applies the general definitions of the distance variable of any pair nodes  within irregular domains, while the RFW transform in [8-11] is to use the coordinate  radius variable of a spherically symmetric domain. In order to manifest this difference,  the anisotropic DFW using the translation invariant solution of the convection-diffusion  equation will be presented in section 5 to deal with directionally dominated track data  problems. In some reports [20], the term “radial function” is indiscriminately applied as  the “radial basis function”. However, this is not case in the radial function wavelets given  in [8-11], where the generalized translation operators [9-11], for example, are traditional  coordinate variable operation. Secondly, the Helmholtz DFW is directly based on the  solution of the Helmholtz equation of arbitrary geometry. Albeit the close relationship  between the Helmholtz partial equation and the ordinary Bessel equation, the latter  nominally only applies to the spherical symmetric domain problems. In other words, the  RFW’s [8-11] are intended to one dimension problem, which uses annuli instead of cubes  in the standard wavelets [21] to get analogous results. Thirdly, the DFW’s involve  general distance variable PDE’s solutions [1,2], e.g., those of the Helmholtz and modified  Helmholtz equations. Fourthly, the general solutions and fundamental solutions of the  Helmholtz equation are separately or combined employed in the corresponding real and  complex Helmholtz DFW transforms and series, whereas the RFW only uses the regular  solution of the Bessel equation. For instance, the Helmholtz-Fourier DFW transform can  degenerate into the Fourier transform in the 1D case when the distance variable is  replaced by coordinate variable.   5

The handbook includes information on the units used to measure physical properties; vectors, and how they are used to show the net effect of various forces; Newton's Laws of motion, and how to use these laws in force and motion applications; and the concepts of energy, work, and power, and how to measure and calculate the energy involved in various applications. This information will provide personnel with a foundation for understanding the basic operation of various types of DOE nuclear facility systems and equipment. Key Words:  Training Material, Classical Physics, Vectors, Newton's Laws, Energy, Work, Power  CLASSICAL PHYSICS Rev. 0 CP FOREWORD The Department of Energy (DOE) Fundamentals Handbooks consist of ten academic subjects, which include Mathematics; Classical Physics; Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer, and Fluid Flow; Instrumentation and Control; Electrical Science; Material Science; Mechanical Science; Chemistry; Engineering Symbology, Prints, and Drawings; and Nuclear Physics and Reactor Theory.  The handbooks are provided as an aid to DOE nuclear facility contractors. These handbooks were first published as Reactor Operator Fundamentals Manuals in 1985 for use by DOE Category A reactors.  The subject areas, subject matter content, and level of detail of the Reactor Operator Fundamentals Manuals was determined from several sources.  DOE Category A reactor training managers determined which materials should be included, and served as a primary reference in the initial development phase.  Training guidelines from the commercial nuclear power industry, results of job and task analyses, and independent input from contractors and operations-oriented personnel were all considered and included to some degree in developing the text material and learning objectives. The DOE Fundamentals Handbooks represent the needs of various DOE nuclear facilities' fundamentals training requirements.  To increase their applicability to nonreactor nuclear facilities, the Reactor Operator Fundamentals Manual learning objectives were distributed to the Nuclear Facility Training Coordination Program Steering Committee for review and comment.  To update their reactor-specific content, DOE Category A reactor training managers also reviewed and commented on the content.  On the basis of feedback from these sources, information that applied to two or more DOE nuclear facilities was considered generic and was included.  The final draft of each of these handbooks was then reviewed by these two groups.  This approach has resulted in revised modular handbooks that contain sufficient detail such that each facility may adjust the content to fit their specific needs. Each handbook contains an abstract, a foreword, an overview, learning objectives, and text material, and is divided into modules so that content and order may be modified by individual DOE contractors to suit their specific training needs.  Each subject area is supported by a separate examination bank with an answer key. The DOE Fundamentals Handbooks have been prepared for the Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy, Office of Nuclear Safety Policy and Standards, by the DOE Training Coordination Program.  This program is managed by EG&G Idaho, Inc. 
Fisica arXiv:quant-ph/0003146 v1   30 Mar 2000 First LANL draft, March 30, 2000 Does Quantum Nonlocality Exist? Bell’s Theorem and the Many-Worlds Interpretation by Frank J. Tipler1 Department of Mathematics and Department of Physics Tulane University New Orleans, Louisiana 70118 USA Abstract Quantum nonlocality may be an artifact of the assumption that observers obey the laws of classical mechanics, while observed systems obey quantum mechanics. I show that, at least in the case of Bell’s Theorem, locality is restored if observed and observer are both assumed to obey quantum mechanics, as in the Many-Worlds Interpretation. Using the MWI, I shall show that the apparently \non-local" expectation value for the product of the spins of two widely separated particles | the \quantum" part of Bell’s Theorem | is really due to a series of three purely local measurements. Thus, experiments con rming \nonlocality" are actually con rming the MWI. PACS numbers: 03.67.Hk, 42.50.-p, 03.65.Bz, 89.70.+c 1 e-mail address: tipler@mailhost.tcs.tulane.edu 1 Nonlocality is the standard example of a quantum mechanical property not present in classical mechan- ics. Many papers are published each year (in 1997, four in PRL alone [1]; in 1998, six in PRL alone [2]; in 1999, eight in PRL alone [3]; and three in Nature [4]) on the subject of\nonlocality," many (e.g., the papers just cited) showing truly awesome ingenuity. The phenomenon of nonlocality was  rst discussed in the EPR Experiment [5]. We have two spin 1/2 particles, and the two-particle system is in the rotationally invariant singlet state with zero total spin angular momentum. Thus, if we decide to measure the particle spins in the up-down direction, we would write the wave function of such a state as j >= j">1 j#>2  j#>1 j">2p2 (1) where the direction of the arrow denotes the direction of spin, and the subscript denotes the particle. If we decide to measure the particle spins in the left-right direction, the wave function would be written in a left-right basis as j >= j >1 j!>2  j!>1 j >2p2 (2) Nonlocality arises if and only if we assume that the measurement of the spin of a particle "collapses the wave function" from the linear superposition to either j">1 j#>2 or j#>1 j">2 in (1). If such a collapse occurs, then measuring the spin of particle one would  x the spin of particle two. The spin of particle two would be  xed instantaneously, even if the particles had been allowed to separate to large distances. If at the location of particle one, we make a last minute decision to measure the spin of particle one in the left-right direction rather than the up-down direction, then instantaneously the spin of particle two would be  xed in the opposite direction as particle one | if we assume that (2) collapses at the instant we measure the spin of particle one. The mystery of quantum nonlocality lies in trying to understand how particle two changes | instantaneously | in response to what has happened in the location of particle one. There is no mystery. There is no quantum nonlocality. Particle two doesn’t know what has happened to particle one when its spin is measured. State transitions are nice and local in quantum mechanics. These statements are true because quantum mechanics tells us that the wave function does not collapse when the state of a system is measured. In particular, nonlocality disappears when the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) [6,7,8,16] is adopted. The MWI dispels the mysteries of quantum mechanics. D.N. Page has previously shown [9] how the EPR reality criterion is completely ful lled by the MWI. I shall extend his analysis, and show how the \quantum" part of Bell’s Theorem [10], namely the expectation valve for the product of the spins of the two widely separated electrons, a quantity generally believed to be essentially non-local, actually arises from a series of local measurements. To see how nonlocality disappears, let us analyze the measure of the spins of the two particles from the Many-Worlds perspective. Let Mi(:::) denote the initial state of the device which measures the spin of the ith particle. The ellipsis will denote a measurement not yet having been performed. We can for simplicity assume that the apparatus is 100% e cient and that the measurement doesn’t change the spin being measured (putting in a more realistic e ciency and taking into account the fact that measurement may a ect the spin slightly would complicate the notation but the conclusions would be unchanged). That is, if each particle happens to be in an eigenstate of spin, a measurement of the ith particle changes the measuring device | but not the spin of the particle | as follows: U1M1(:::)j">1= M1(")j">1; U1M1(:::)j#>1= M1(#)j#>1 (3) U2M2(:::)j">2= M2(")j">2; U2M2(:::)j#>2= M2(#)j#>2 (4) whereUi are linear operators which generates the change of state in the measurement apparatus, correspond- ing to the measurement. In particular, if particle 1 is in an eigenstate of spin up, and particle 2 is in an eigenstate of spin down, then the e ect of the Ui’s together is 2 U2U1M1(:::)M2(:::)j">1 j#>2= M1(")M2(#)j">1 j#>2 (5) even if particles 1 and 2 are light years apart when their spin orientations are measured. Similarly, the result of measuring the ith particle in the eigenstate of spin left would be UiMi(:::)j >i= Mi( )j >i, and for an eigenstate of spin right UiMi(:::)j!>i= Mi(!)j!>i, which will generate equations for spins left and right analogous to eqs. (3) (5). Now consider the e ect of a measurement on the two particle system in the Bohm state, that is, with total spin zero. This state is (1) or (2) with respect to an up/down or left/right basis respectively. The result is completely determined by linearity and the assumed correct measurements on single electrons in eigenstates. For example, the e ect of measurements in which both observers happen to choose to measure with respect to the up/down basis is U2U1M2(:::)M1(:::)  j"> 1 j#>2  j#>1 j">2p 2   = U2M2(:::)  M 1(")j">1 j#>2p 2   M1(#)j#>1 j">2p 2   = M2(#)M1(")j">1 j#>2p2  M2(")M1(#)j#>1 j">2p2 (6) It may appear from eqn. (6) that it is the  rst measurement to be carried out that determines the split into the two worlds represented by two terms in (6). This is false. In fact, if the measurements are carried out at spacetime events which are spacelike separated, then there is no Lorentz invariant way of determining which measurement was carried out  rst. At spacelike separation, the measuring operators U1 andU2 commute, and so we can equally well perform the measurement of the spins of the electrons in reverse order and obtain the same splits: U1U2M1(:::)M2(:::)  j"> 1 j#>2  j#>1 j">2p 2   = U1M1(:::)  M 2(#)j">1 j#>2p 2   M2(")j#>1 j">2p 2   = M1(")M2(#)j">1 j#>2p2  M1(#)M2(")j#>1 j">2p2 (7) the last line of which is the same as that of (6), (except for the order of states, which is irrelevant). The e ect of measurements in which both observers happen to choose to measure with respect to the left/right basis is U2U1M2(:::)M1(:::)  j > 1 j!>2  j!>1 j >2p 2   = U2M2(:::)  M 1( )j >1 j!>2p 2   M1(!)j!>1 j >2p 2   = M2(!)M1( )j >1 j!>2p2  M2( )M1(!)j!>1 j >2p2 (8) A comparison of (6)/(7) with (8) shows that if two spacelike-separated observers fortuitously happen to measure the spins of the two particles in the same direction | whatever this same direction happens to be | both observers will split into two distinct worlds, and in each world the observers will measure opposite spin projections for the electrons. But at each event of observation, both of the two possible outcomes of the measurement will be obtained. Locality is preserved, because indeed both outcomes are obtained in total 3 independence of the outcomes of the other measurement. The linearity of the operators U1 and U2 forces the perfect anti-correlation of the spins of the particles in each world. Since the singlet state is rotationally invariant, the same result would be obtained whatever direction the observers happened to choose to measure the spins. In the EPR experiment, there is actually a third measurement: the comparison of the two observations made by the spatially separated observers. In fact, the relative directions of the two spin measurements have no meaning without this third measurement. Once again, it is easily seen that initialization of this third measurement by the two previous measurements, plus linearity implies that this third measurement will con rm the split into two worlds. In the usual analysis, this third measurement is not considered a quantum measurement at all, because the  rst measurements are considered as transferring the data from the quantum to the classical regime. But in the MWI, there is no classical regime; the comparison of the data in two macroscopic devices is just a much a quantum interaction as the original setting up of the singlet state. Furthermore, this ignored third measurement is actually of crucial importance: it is performed after information about the orientation of the second device has been carried back to the  rst device (at a speed less than light!). The orientation is coded with correlations of the spins of both electrons, and these correlations (and the linearity of all operators) will force the third measurement to respect the original split. These correlations have not been lost, for no measurement reduces the wave function: the minus sign between the two worlds is present in all eqns. (1) | (8). To see explicitly how this third measurement works, represent the state of the comparison apparatus by Mc[(:::)1(:::)2], where the  rst entry measures the record of the apparatus measuring the  rst particle, and the second entry measures the record of the apparatus measuring the second particle. Thus, the third measurement acting on eigenstates of the spin-measurement devices transforms the comparison apparatus as follows: UcMc[(:::)1(:::)2]M1(") = Mc[(")1(:::)2]M1(") UcMc[(:::)1(:::)2]M1(#) = Mc[(#)1(:::)2]M1(#) UcMc[(:::)1(:::)2]M2(") = Mc[(:::)1(")2]M2(") UcMc[(:::)1(:::)2]M2(#) = Mc[(:::)1(#)2]M2(#) where for simplicity I have assumed the spins will be measured in the up or down direction. Then for the state (1), the totality of the three measurements together | the two measurements of the particle spins followed by the comparison measurement | is UcU2U1Mc[(:::)1(:::)2]M2(:::)M1(:::)  j"> 1 j#>2  j#>1 j">2p 2   = = Mc[(")1(#)2]M2(#)M1(")j">1 j#>2p2  Mc[(#)1(")2]M2(")M1(#)j#>1 j">2p2 Heretofore I have assumed that the two observers have chosen to measure the spins in the same direction. For observers who make the decision of which direction to measure the spin in the instant before the measurement, most of the time the two directions will not be the same. The experiment could be carried out by throwing away all observations except those in which the chosen directions happened to agree within a predetermined tolerance. But this would waste most of the data. The Aspect-Clauser-Freedman Experiment [11] is designed to use more of the data by testing Bell’s Inequality for the expectation value of the product of the spins of the two electrons with the spin of one electron being measured in direction ^n1, and the spin of the other in direction ^n2. If the spins are measured in units of  h=2, the standard QM expectation value for the product is <  j(^n1  1)(^n2  2)j >= ^n1 ^n2 (9) 4 where j > is the singlet state (1)/(2). In particular, ^n1 = ^n2 is the assumed set-up of the previous discussion. Since the MWI shows that local measurements in this case always gives +1 for one electron and -1 for the other, the product of the two is always -1 in all worlds, and thus the expectation value for the product is -1, in complete agreement with (9). To show how (9) comes about by local measurements splitting the universe into distinct worlds, I follow [12] and write the singlet state (1)/(2) with respect to some basis in the ^n1 direction as j >= (1=p2)(j^n1;">1 j^n1;#>2  j^n1;#>1 j^n1;">2) (10) Let another direction ^n2 be the polar axis, with  the polar angle of ^n1 relative to ^n2. Without loss of generality, we can choose the other coordinates so that the azimuthal angle of ^n1 is zero. Standard rotation operators for spinor states then give [12] j^n1;">2= (cos =2)j^n2;">2 + (sin =2)j^n2;#>2 j^n1;#>2= (sin =2)j^n2;">2 + (cos =2)j^n2;#>2 which yields j >= (1=p2)[ (sin =2)j^n1;">1j^n2;">2 + (cos =2)j^n1;">1 j^n2;#>2  (cos =2)j^n1;#>1j^n2;">2  (sin =2)j^n1;#>1 j^n2;#>2] (11) In other words, if the two devices measure the spins in arbitrary directions, there will be a split into four worlds, one for each possible permutation of the electron spins. Just as in the case with ^n1 = ^n2, normalization of the devices on eigenstates plus linearity forces the devices to split into all of these four worlds, which are the only possible worlds, since each observer must measure the electron to have spin +1 or  1. The squares of the coe cients in (11) are proportional to the number of worlds wherein each respective possibility occurs, these possibilities being determined by the chosen experimental arrangement. This is most easily seen using Deutsch’s MWI derivation [13,16] of the Born Interpretation (BI). DeWitt and Graham [7] originally deduced the BI using the relative frequency theory of probability [14,15], and this derivation is open to the standard objections to the frequency theory [14,15]. Deutsch instead derives the BI using the Principle of Indi erence of the classical/a priori theory of probability [14]. According to the Principle of Indi erence, the probability of an event is the number of times the event occurs in a collection of equipossible cases divided by the total number of equipossible cases. Thus, the probability is 1/6 that a single die throw will result in a 5, because there are 6 equipossible sides that could appear, of which the 5 is exactly 1. Deutsch assumes the Principle of Indi erence applies to any experimental arrangement in which the expansion of the wave function j > in terms of the orthonormal basis vectors of the experiment (the interpretation basis) give equal coe cients for each term in the expansion. For example, both (1) and (2) are two such expansions, because in both cases the coe cients of each of the two terms is 1=p2. The Principle of Indi erence thus says that each of the two possibilities is equally likely in either the experimental arrangement (1), or in the interpretation basis (2). Equivalently, there are an equal number of worlds corresponding to each term in either (1) or (2), since in the MWI \equally possible" means \equal number of worlds" (equal relative to a preset experimental arrangement). Deutsch shows [13,16] that if the squares of the coe cients in the interpretation basis of an experiment are rational, then a new experimental arrangement can be found in which the coe cients are equal in the new interpretation basis. Applying the Principle of Indi erence to this new set of coe cients yields the BI for the coe cients in the original basis. Continuity in the Hilbert space of wave functions yields the BI for irrational coe cients (although it is a presupposition of the MWI that only coe cients with rational squares are allowed since irrational squares would imply an irrational number of worlds). In particular, the percentage of worlds with the value of a given basis vector is given by the square of the coe cient. 5

Analitica  36   CHAPTER III    THE REVISIONISTS   The claims of the revisionists  Everyone today knows that there is a group of people who radically question the  prevalent image of the fate of the Jews under the Third Reich. These people call  themselves "Revisionists", or, more precisely, "Holocaust Revisionists". The media  bespatters them with idiotic smear words like "Auschwitz Deniers", and lumps them  together with "Right-wing Radicals".  If you were to ask the average German what the revisionists actually say, and what  they their statements are based on, he would be unable to answer. This is quite  inevitable because of strict media control; the media have strict instructions not to  permit any expression or discussion of revisionist arguments. Thus, many people are  given the completely erroneous impression that the revisionists deny Jewish suffering  during the Second World War. In reality, no one denies that a considerable number of  Jews under German rule were interned in concentration camps, or that large numbers  of deportees died of epidemics and exhaustion. Nor does anyone deny the reality of  shootings of Jews, particularly, on the Eastern Front.   Revisionists dispute the following three points in particular:  1) That there was a plan for the physical liquidation of the Jews;  2) The existence of "extermination camps" with gas chambers for mass killing of  human beings;  3) That five to six million Jews died in German occupied Europe.  It is also not true that revisionism is a "Right-wing radical" movement, since it is not  an ideology. It is, as Prof. Robert Faurisson likes to say, a method. Revisionists  examine the official picture of the "Holocaust" using the same methods which are  generally recognized as valid for other historical periods.  Of course, it is also true that most revisionists are politically to the Right, and that  some of them are acknowledged National Socialists, but this has no influence on the  correctness or incorrectness of their arguments. Whether the discoverer of a new  planet is conservative, liberal, socialist, or Communist, is irrelevant to the history of  science. What counts is the discovery of a new planet!   Furthermore, some of the best-known revisionists, for example, the Frenchmen Serge  Thion and Pierre Guillaume, are on the Left.   37 A former concentration camp inmate as revisionist pioneer:   Paul Rassinier  The founder of revisionism also came from the left. Paul Rassinier, a French  resistance fighter, a Socialist and detainee at Buchenwald and Dora-Mittelbau  concentration camps. In his book Le Mensonge d'Ulysse (the Lies of Ulysses), which  appeared in 1950, Rassinier denounced the endlessly exaggerated tales told by former  inmates of German camps. Over the course of years of research, Rassinier finally  came to the conclusion that gassings had either not taken place at all, or had taken  place only as the act of a few lunatics. In Le Drame des Juifs européens (1964),  Rassinier wrote a few years before his death (1):  "For 15 years, every time that I heard of a witness anywhere, no matter where  in the portion of Europe that was not occupied by the Soviets, who claimed to  have himself been present at gas exterminations, I immediately went to him to  get his testimony. With documentation in hand, I would ask him so many  precise and detailed questions that soon it became apparent that he could not  answer except by lying. Often his lies became so transparent, even to himself,  that he ended his testimony by declaring that he had not seen it himself, but  that one of his good friends, who had died in the camps and whose good faith  he could not doubt, had told him about it. I covered thousands and thousands  of kilometers throughout Europe in this way."  Since nobody else wanted to print Rassinier's works, he finally had them published by  a publishing house closely associated with the "Extreme Right" (Les Sept Couleurs).  The hypocrites who reproach him for having them published them there, would no  doubt have preferred to see them never published at all.   Media vilification of the revisionists  If we observe the campaign against the revisionists carried on by the media clique, we  immediately note a series of remarkable features:  First, revisionist literature is flatly stated to have no credibility at all. Thus, a Swiss  women named Klara Obermueller wrote as follows in an anti-revisionist series (2):  "If somebody came along today and reported the calling of a scientific  congress to examine the question of whether the sun revolves around the earth  or the earth around the sun, he would either be ridiculed or declared non- compos mentis. It wouldn't occur to anyone to discuss the matter seriously... A  similar thing occurs with the propagandists of the so-called 'Auschwitz Lie' or  'Holocaust Lie': their statements that there was no extermination of the Jews, is  so obviously false that it is basically unworthy of serious scientific  discussion."   According to the above, the revisionists are purely and simply crazy. So why  persecute them? Why not just ignore them? Do people take you to court if you say the  earth doesn't revolve around the sun?   38 Peculiarly, these same lunatics appear to be highly dangerous to the "Western  democracies"; they even appear to threaten the very basis of that society in an  extremely serious way. A hack journalist named Patrick Bahners, writing in the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 15 August 1994 in connection with the sentencing  of Günter Deckert, revisionist and Chairman of the NPD, by the German legal system,  said:  "If Deckert's attitude on the Holocaust were correct, the Bundesrepublik would  be based on a lie. Every Presidential speech, every minute of silence, every  history book would be a lie. Therefore, anyone who denies the mass murder of  the Jews disputes the legitimacy of the Bundesrepublik."  How can a handful of lunatics endanger the legitimacy of the Bundesrepublik? No,  the journalists must finally recognize that there is something askew in this argument:  either the revisionists are lunatics, in which case they aren't dangerous, and the  journalists can spare the energy wasted on all their hysterical hate campaigns; or they  are highly dangerous to the ruling system of the West, in which case they are not  lunatics! You can't have it both ways; the media must decide one or the other.  State prosecutors and judges as watch dogs for the official version of history  The matter becomes even more suspicious when we learn that "denying" the  Holocaust (a more correct term would be "disputing the genocide of the Jews") are  liable for criminal prosecution in several European countries (3). The model for this  impudent interference of the criminal justice system in the freedom of research is  perhaps the French "Loi Gayssot", passed in France in 1990 (4), which provides for  criminal penalties for anyone disputing any matter decided by the International  Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. The sentence of the Nuremberg victor's tribunal has  therefore been declared infallible in France; it has been canonized, as it were. Even  Stalin did nothing of the kind.  In the BRD, revisionists are prosecuted according to paragraph 130 of the Criminal  Code ("Incitement to Racial Hatred") Paragraph 131 ("Slandering the Dead") and  paragraph 189 ("Slandering the Dead"). The first paragraph was considerably  broadened on 28 October 1994, and now calls for prison terms of up to five years for  anyone who approves, denies, or trivializes any criminal act alleged to have been  committed by the National Socialists. Since that date, there have been thousands of  trials of revisionists in Germany just since 28 October 1994.  In Austria, the so-called "Prohibition Law" against National Socialist activities has  served as the Hexenhammer in suppressing the freedom of research on the Holocaust  since 1992.   In France, Holocaust revisionists are liable for imprisonment for one year; in the  BRD, five years; and in Austria, ten years. In practice, however, the penalties are not  that severe. Not yet!   39 Here are the sentences from some particularly spectacular revisionist trials  in the BRD:  - in October 1992, Major General Remer, one of the most highly decorated soldiers of  WWII, was sentenced to 22 months without probation in Schweinfurt for "Holocaust  Denial", which, for the seriously ill old man, would have been equivalent to a death  sentence (Aktenzeichen Remer 1 Kls 8 Js 7494/91). Rather than serve the sentence,  Remer, accompanied by his wife, went into exile in Spain;  - in April 1995, Günter Deckert, Chairman of the NPD, was sentenced to two years  without probation for translating a technical talk by US gas chamber expert Fred  Leuchter (Aktenzeichen IV Kls 1/95 - 2AK 1/95). That Deckert laughed several times  during the translation, and shortened the sacrosanct Holy Word "Holocaust" to "Holo"  for short, was considered to have aggravated the offense (5);  - In June 1995, the chemist Germar Rudolf was sentenced to 14 months imprisonment  without probation in Stuttgart (Aktenzeichen 17 Kls 83/94). This sentence was passed  on the pretext that Major General Remer had sent Rudolf's report on the "gas  chambers" at Auschwitz (see chapter XII) to politicians, professors, and the media (6);  - In May 1996, the publisher Wigbert Grabert was fined 30,000 DM for publishing a  scientific revisionist anthology with the title Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte  (Aktenzeichen AG Tübingen 4 Gs 173/95)   - in May 1996, the political scientist and publisher Udo Walendy was sentenced to 15  months without probation (Aktenzeichen 2 Kls 46 Js 374/95 STA Bielefeld) for  "trivializing the Holocaust" (7).  In none of these terror trials did the court spend as much as one single second  considering the arguments of the defendants. Every case assumed the  "Offenkundigkeit" of the Holocaust, i.e., its alleged status as a "proven fact". This  "Offenkundigkeit", believe it or not, dates back to 1945! According to article 21 of the  London Statutes of August 1945, which established the procedural rules for the  Nuremberg Trials, no proof was required of "facts of common knowledge". Just what  constituted a "fact of common knowledge" was, of course, decided by the court itself - - a court which, in the words of chief prosecutor Robert Jackson, considered its  actions a "continuation of the war against Germany" (8). Thus, the status of the  "Offenkundigkeit" of an assembly-line extermination of the Jews with millions of  victims, was simply considered to be a "fact of common knowledge", for which,  therefore, no proof other than "confessions" and "eyewitness testimonies" is available  today.   All these trials violate the basic right to free expression of opinion as guaranteed  under the Constitutions of all the states concerned. It is also illegal to deny a  defendant any opportunity to prove the truth of his statements; instead, expert reports  on the technical impossibilities of the reported mass extermination are always rejected  with reference to the "Offenkundigkeit" of the Holocaust.  Generally, the very notion that jurists are competent to decide matters of historical  fact is grotesque in itself. The following is an example:   40 In the book Hat Karl der Grosse Je Gelebt? [Was There Ever Really a Charlemagne?]  (9), the Munich scholar Herbert Illig disputes the existence of Charlemagne, and  declares the whole period from 614 to 911 A.D. to be a product of fantasy. This entire  period of 297 years, together with Charlemagne and all the other historical figures of  the same period, are alleged to have been invented by subsequent falsifiers of history  for political reasons. The absence of any structures built during the three so-called  "centuries of the Dark Ages" is the logical result of the non-existence of this period of  history: an analysis of architectural monuments is said to show that the few structures  alleged to have been built during this period, were, in reality, built later.   Due to an insufficient familiarity with the history of the early Middle Ages on our  part, we shall refrain from expressing an opinion as to the value of Illig's book. If his  arguments should prove to be sheer fantasy, they will be ignored. If they should prove  correct, the author will be sooner or later have to be recognized as a genius. There is  another, third possibility, i.e., that Charlemagne actually lived, but never performed  many of the heroic deeds attributed to him. In this case, Illig's work would still have a  seminal influence upon the writing of history by pointing out its shortcomings --  particularly, an overly blind trust in the reliability of the sources employed.   One thing is for certain: Illig will never be hauled into court because of his book. No  judge will ever jail him for "Denying the Genocide of the Pagans", although, by  disputing Charlemagne's existence, he is, in effect, denying the mass murder of Saxon  pagans attributed to him.  In short, Charlemagne, or any other historical subject for that matter, may be  researched with complete freedom and the broadest possible latitude. The same  statement is true of every other period of history -- except the Second World War,  and, in particular, the fate of the Jews under the Third Reich. This fact alone ought to  make every thinking person deeply suspicious: "truths" that require protection by  criminal law usually turn out to be lies.   The bankruptcy of the official version of history  "Historians have only interpreted the Holocaust. The thing is to research it."   Ulrich Herbert, German historian, in the Frankfurter Rundschau of 13 February 1997,  p. 7.  The Lausanne daily Nouveau Quotidien on 2 and 3 September 1996, published two  articles by the historian Jacques Baynac (an anti-revisionist). The first bore the  promising title "How the Historians Turned the Job of Silencing the Revisionists Over  to the Courts". That means: the governmental persecution of revisionists described  above is the logical consequence of the inability of orthodox historians to come up  with any counter-argument with which to answer the revisionists. While revisionists  RESEARCH the Holocaust, historians are simply content to INTERPRET it. The  facts are irrelevant.   An excellent example of this may be seen in Gunnar Heinsohn's book Warum  Auschwitz? [Why Auschwitz?] (10). At the very beginning of the book, Heinsohn  mentions an alleged Himmler order issued on 25 November 1944 on the disassembly  
Analitica A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning Pedro Domingos Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of Washington Seattle, WA 98195-2350, U.S.A.pedrod@cs.washington.edu ABSTRACT Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform important tasks by generalizing from examples. This is of- ten feasible and cost-effective where manual programming is not. As more data becomes available, more ambitious problems can be tackled. As a result, machine learning is widely used in computer science and other fields. However, developing successful machine learning applications requires a substantial amount of “black art” that is hard to find in textbooks. This article summarizes twelve key lessons that machine learning researchers and practitioners have learned. These include pitfalls to avoid, important issues to focus on, and answers to common questions. 1. INTRODUCTION Machinelearningsystemsautomaticallylearnprogramsfrom data. This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. Machine learning is used in Web search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. A recent report from the McKinsey Global In- stitute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation [16]. Several fine textbooks are available to inter- ested practitioners and researchers (e.g, [17, 25]). However, much of the “folk knowledge” that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily avail- able in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less- than-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate. This is the purpose of this article. Many different types of machine learning exist, but for il- lustration purposes I will focus on the most mature and widely used one: classification. Nevertheless, the issues I will discuss apply across all of machine learning. A classi- fier is a system that inputs (typically) a vector of discrete and/or continuous feature values and outputs a single dis- crete value, the class. For example, a spam filter classifies email messages into“spam”or“not spam,”and its input may be a Boolean vector x = (x1,...,xj,...,xd), where xj = 1 if the jth word in the dictionary appears in the email and xj = 0 otherwise. A learner inputs a training set of exam- ples (xi,yi), where xi = (xi,1,...,xi,d) is an observed input and yi is the corresponding output, and outputs a classifier. The test of the learner is whether this classifier produces the correct output yt for future examples xt (e.g., whether the spam filter correctly classifies previously unseen emails as spam or not spam). 2. LEARNING = REPRESENTATION + EVALUATION + OPTIMIZATION Suppose you have an application that you think machine learning might be good for. The first problem facing you is the bewildering variety of learning algorithms available. Which one to use? There are literally thousands available, and hundreds more are published each year. The key to not getting lost in this huge space is to realize that it consists of combinations of just three components. The components are: Representation. A classifier must be represented in some formal language that the computer can handle. Con- versely, choosing a representation for a learner is tan- tamount to choosing the set of classifiers that it can possibly learn. This set is called the hypothesis space of the learner. If a classifier is not in the hypothesis space, it cannot be learned. A related question, which we will address in a later section, is how to represent the input, i.e., what features to use. Evaluation. An evaluation function (also called objective function or scoring function) is needed to distinguish good classifiersfrom bad ones. The evaluationfunction used internally by the algorithm may differ from the external one that we want the classifier to optimize, for ease of optimization (see below) and due to the issues discussed in the next section. Optimization. Finally, we need a method to search among the classifiers in the language for the highest-scoring one. The choice of optimization technique is key to the efficiency of the learner, and also helps determine the classifier produced if the evaluation function has more than one optimum. It is common for new learners to start out using off-the-shelf optimizers, which are later replaced by custom-designed ones. Table 1 shows common examples of each of these three com- ponents. For example, k-nearest neighbor classifies a test example by finding the k most similar training examples and predicting the majority class among them. Hyperplane- based methods form a linear combination of the features per class and predict the class with the highest-valued combina- tion. Decision trees test one feature at each internal node, Table 1: The three components of learning algorithms. Representation Evaluation Optimization Instances Accuracy/Error rate Combinatorial optimization K-nearest neighbor Precision and recall Greedy search Support vector machines Squared error Beam search Hyperplanes Likelihood Branch-and-bound Naive Bayes Posterior probability Continuous optimization Logistic regression Information gain Unconstrained Decision trees K-L divergence Gradient descent Sets of rules Cost/Utility Conjugate gradient Propositional rules Margin Quasi-Newton methods Logic programs Constrained Neural networks Linear programming Graphical models Quadratic programming Bayesian networks Conditional random fields with one branchfor each feature value, and have class predic- tions at the leaves. Algorithm 1 shows a bare-bones decision tree learner for Boolean domains, using information gain and greedy search [21]. InfoGain(xj,y) is the mutual information between feature xj and the class y. MakeNode(x,c0,c1) re- turns a node that tests feature x and has c0 as the child for x = 0 and c1 as the child for x = 1. Of course, not all combinations of one component from each column of Table 1 make equal sense. For example, dis- crete representations naturally go with combinatorial op- timization, and continuous ones with continuous optimiza- tion. Nevertheless, many learners have both discrete and continuous components, and in fact the day may not be far when every single possible combination has appeared in some learner! Most textbooks are organized by representation, and it’s easy to overlook the fact that the other components are equally important. There is no simple recipe for choosing each component, but the next sections touch on some of the key issues. And, as we will see below, some choices in a machine learning project may be even more important than the choice of learner. 3. IT’SGENERALIZATIONTHATCOUNTS The fundamental goal of machine learning is to generalize beyond the examples in the training set. This is because, no matter how much data we have, it is very unlikely that we will see those exact examples again at test time. (No- tice that, if there are 100,000 words in the dictionary, the spam filter described above has 2100,000 possible different in- puts.) Doing well on the training set is easy (just memorize the examples). The most common mistake among machine learning beginners is to test on the training data and have the illusion of success. If the chosen classifier is then tested on new data, it is often no better than random guessing. So, if you hire someone to build a classifier, be sure to keep some of the data to yourself and test the classifier they give you on it. Conversely, if you’ve been hired to build a classifier, set some of the data aside from the beginning, and only use it to test your chosen classifier at the very end, followed by learning your final classifier on the whole data. Algorithm 1 LearnDT(TrainSet) if all examples in TrainSet have the same class y? then return MakeLeaf(y?) if no feature xj has InfoGain(xj,y) > 0 then y? ?Most frequent class in TrainSet return MakeLeaf(y?) x? ?argmaxxj InfoGain(xj,y) TS0 ?Examples in TrainSet with x? = 0 TS1 ?Examples in TrainSet with x? = 1 return MakeNode(x?, LearnDT(TS0), LearnDT(TS1)) Contamination of your classifier by test data can occur in insidious ways, e.g., if you use test data to tune parameters and do a lot of tuning. (Machine learning algorithms have lots of knobs, and success often comes from twiddling them a lot, so this is a real concern.) Of course, holding out data reduces the amount available for training. This can be mitigated by doing cross-validation: randomly dividing your training data into (say) ten subsets, holding out each one while training on the rest, testing each learned classifier on the examples it did not see, and averaging the results to see how well the particular parameter setting does. In the early days of machine learning, the need to keep train- ing and test data separate was not widely appreciated. This was partly because, if the learner has a very limited repre- sentation (e.g., hyperplanes), the difference between train- ing and test error may not be large. But with very flexible classifiers (e.g., decision trees), or even with linear classifiers with a lot of features, strict separation is mandatory. Notice that generalization being the goal has an interesting consequence for machine learning. Unlike in most other op- timization problems, we don’t have access to the function we want to optimize! We have to use training error as a sur- rogate for test error, and this is fraught with danger. How to deal with it is addressed in some of the next sections. On the positive side, since the objective function is only a proxy for the true goal, we may not need to fully optimize it; in fact, a local optimum returned by simple greedy search may be better than the global optimum. 4. DATA ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH Generalizationbeingthegoalhasanothermajorconsequence: data alone is not enough, no matter how much of it you have. Consider learning a Boolean function of (say) 100 variables from a million examples. There are 2100 ?106 examples whose classes you don’t know. How do you figure out what those classes are? In the absence of further information, there is just no way to do this that beats flipping a coin. This observation was first made (in somewhat different form) by the philosopher David Hume over 200 years ago, but even today many mistakes in machine learning stem from failing to appreciate it. Every learner must embody some knowl- edge or assumptions beyond the data it’s given in order to generalize beyond it. This was formalized by Wolpert in his famous“no free lunch”theorems, according to which no learner can beat random guessing over all possible functions to be learned [26]. This seems like rather depressing news. How then can we ever hope to learn anything? Luckily, the functions we want to learn in the real world are not drawn uniformly from the set of all mathematically possible functions! In fact, very general assumptions—like smoothness, similar exam- ples having similar classes, limited dependences, or limited complexity—are often enough to do very well, and this is a large part of why machine learning has been so successful. Like deduction, induction (what learners do) is a knowledge lever: it turns a small amount of input knowledge into a large amount of output knowledge. Induction is a vastly more powerful lever than deduction, requiring much less in- put knowledge to produce useful results, but it still needs more than zero input knowledge to work. And, as with any lever, the more we put in, the more we can get out. A corollary of this is that one of the key criteria for choos- ing a representation is which kinds of knowledge are easily expressed in it. For example, if we have a lot of knowledge about what makes examples similar in our domain, instance- based methods may be a good choice. If we have knowl- edge about probabilistic dependencies, graphical models are a good fit. And if we have knowledge about what kinds of preconditions are required by each class,“IF ... THEN ...” rules may be the the best option. The most useful learners in this regard are those that don’t just have assumptions hard-wired into them, but allow us to state them explicitly, vary them widely, and incorporate them automatically into the learning (e.g., using first-order logic [22] or grammars [6]). In retrospect, the need for knowledge in learning should not be surprising. Machine learning is not magic; it can’t get something from nothing. What it does is get more from less. Programming, like all engineering, is a lot of work: we have to build everything from scratch. Learning is more like farming, which lets nature do most of the work. Farm- ers combine seeds with nutrients to grow crops. Learners combine knowledge with data to grow programs. 5. OVERFITTING HAS MANY FACES What if the knowledge and data we have are not sufficient to completely determine the correct classifier? Then we run the risk of just hallucinating a classifier (or parts of it) that is not grounded in reality, and is simply encoding random High Bias Low Bias Low Variance High Variance Figure 1: Bias and variance in dart-throwing. quirks in the data. This problem is called overfitting, and is the bugbear of machine learning. When your learner outputs a classifier that is 100% accurate on the training data but only 50% accurate on test data, when in fact it could have output one that is 75% accurate on both, it has overfit. Everyone in machine learning knows about overfitting, but it comes in many forms that are not immediately obvious. One way to understand overfitting is by decomposing gener- alization error into bias and variance [9]. Bias is a learner’s tendency to consistently learn the same wrong thing. Vari- ance is the tendency to learn random things irrespective of the real signal. Figure 1 illustrates this by an analogy with throwing darts at a board. A linear learner has high bias, because when the frontier between two classes is not a hyper- plane the learner is unable to induce it. Decision trees don’t have this problem because they can represent any Boolean function, but on the other hand they can suffer from high variance: decision trees learned on different training sets generated by the same phenomenon are often very different, when in fact they should be the same. Similar reasoning applies to the choice of optimization method: beam search has lower bias than greedy search, but higher variance, be- cause it tries more hypotheses. Thus, contrary to intuition, a more powerful learner is not necessarily better than a less powerful one. Figure 2 illustrates this.1 Even though the true classifier is a set of rules, with up to 1000 examples naive Bayes is more accurate than a rule learner. This happens despite naive Bayes’s false assumption that the frontier is linear! Situations like this are common in machine learning: strong false assumptionscan be better thanweak trueones, because a learner with the latter needs more data to avoid overfitting. 1Training examples consist of 64 Boolean features and a Boolean class computed from them according to a set of“IF ... THEN ...”rules. The curves are the average of 100 runs with different randomly generated sets of rules. Error bars are two standard deviations. See Domingos and Pazzani [11] for details. Cross-validation can help to combat overfitting, for example by using it to choose the best size of decision tree to learn. But it’s no panacea, since if we use it to make too many parameter choices it can itself start to overfit [18]. Besides cross-validation, there are many methods to combat overfitting. The most popular one is adding a regulariza- tion term to the evaluation function. This can, for exam- ple, penalize classifiers with more structure, thereby favoring smaller ones with less room to overfit. Another option is to perform a statistical significance test like chi-square before adding new structure, to decide whether the distribution of the class really is different with and without this structure. These techniques are particularly useful when data is very scarce. Nevertheless, you should be skeptical of claims that a particular technique “solves” the overfitting problem. It’s easy to avoid overfitting (variance) by falling into the op- posite error of underfitting (bias). Simultaneously avoiding both requires learning a perfect classifier, and short of know- ing it in advance there is no single technique that will always do best (no free lunch). Acommonmisconceptionaboutoverfittingisthatitiscaused by noise, like training examples labeled with the wrong class. This can indeed aggravate overfitting, by making the learner draw a capricious frontier to keep those examples on what it thinks is the right side. But severe overfitting can occur even in theabsenceof noise. For instance, supposewe learn a Boolean classifier that is just the disjunction of the examples labeled“true”in the training set. (In other words, the classi- fier is a Boolean formula in disjunctive normal form, where each term is the conjunction of the feature values of one specific training example). This classifier gets all the train- ing examples right and every positive test example wrong, regardless of whether the training data is noisy or not. The problem of multiple testing [14] is closely related to over- fitting. Standard statistical tests assume that only one hy- pothesis is being tested, but modern learners can easily test millions before they are done. As a result what looks signif- icant may in fact not be. For example, a mutual fund that beats the market ten years in a row looks very impressive, until you realize that, if there are 1000 funds and each has a 50% chance of beating the market on any given year, it’s quite likely that one will succeed all ten times just by luck. This problem can be combatted by correcting the signifi- cance tests to take the number of hypotheses into account, but this can lead to underfitting. A better approach is to control the fraction of falsely accepted non-null hypotheses, known as the false discovery rate [3]. 6. INTUITION FAILS IN HIGH DIMENSIONS After overfitting, the biggest problem in machine learning is the curse of dimensionality. This expression was coined by Bellman in 1961 to refer to the fact that many algo- rithms that work fine in low dimensions become intractable when the input is high-dimensional. But in machine learn- ing it refers to much more. Generalizing correctly becomes exponentially harder as the dimensionality (number of fea- tures) of the examples grows, because a fixed-size training set covers a dwindling fraction of the input space. Even with a moderate dimension of 100 and a huge training set of a 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 10 100 1000 10000 Test-Set Accuracy (%) Number of Examples Bayes C4.5 Figure 2: Naive Bayes can outperform a state-of- the-art rule learner (C4.5rules) even when the true classifier is a set of rules. trillion examples, the latter covers only a fraction of about 10?18 of the input space. This is what makes machine learn- ing both necessary and hard. More seriously, the similarity-based reasoning that machine learningalgorithmsdependon(explicitlyorimplicitly)breaks down in high dimensions. Consider a nearest neighbor clas- sifier with Hamming distance as the similarity measure, and suppose the class is just x1?x2. If there are no other fea- tures, this is an easy problem. But if there are 98 irrele- vant features x3,...,x100, the noise from them completely swamps the signal in x1 and x2, and nearest neighbor effec- tively makes random predictions. Even more disturbing is that nearest neighbor still has a problem even if all 100 features are relevant! This is because in high dimensions all examples look alike. Suppose, for instance, that examples are laid out on a regular grid, and consider a test example xt. If the grid is d-dimensional, xt’s 2d nearest examples are all at the same distance from it. So as the dimensionality increases, more and more examples become nearest neighbors of xt, until the choice of nearest neighbor (and therefore of class) is effectively random. This is only one instance of a more general problem with high dimensions: our intuitions, which come from a three- dimensional world, often do not apply in high-dimensional ones. In high dimensions, most of the mass of a multivari- ate Gaussian distribution is not near the mean, but in an increasingly distant “shell” around it; and most of the vol- ume of a high-dimensionalorange is in the skin, not the pulp. If a constant number of examples is distributed uniformly in a high-dimensional hypercube, beyond some dimensionality most examples are closer to a face of the hypercube than to their nearest neighbor. And if we approximate a hyper- sphere by inscribing it in a hypercube, in high dimensions almost all the volume of the hypercube is outside the hyper- sphere. This is bad news for machine learning, where shapes of one type are often approximated by shapes of another. Building a classifier in two or three dimensions is easy; we can find a reasonable frontier between examples of different classes just by visual inspection. (It’s even been said that if people could see in high dimensions machine learning would not be necessary.) But in high dimensions it’s hard to under- stand what is happening. This in turn makes it difficult to design a good classifier. Naively, one might think that gath- ering more features never hurts, since at worst they provide no new information about the class. But in fact their bene- fits may be outweighed by the curse of dimensionality. Fortunately, there is an effect that partly counteracts the curse, whichmightbecalledthe“blessingofnon-uniformity.” In most applications examples are not spread uniformly thr- oughout the instance space, but are concentrated on or near a lower-dimensional manifold. For example, k-nearest neigh- bor works quite well for handwritten digit recognition even though images of digits have one dimension per pixel, be- cause the space of digit images is much smaller than the space of all possible images. Learners can implicitly take advantage of this lower effective dimension, or algorithms for explicitly reducing the dimensionality can be used (e.g., [23]). 7. THEORETICAL GUARANTEES ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM Machine learning papers are full of theoretical guarantees. The most common type is a bound on the number of ex- amples needed to ensure good generalization. What should you make of these guarantees? First of all, it’s remarkable that they are even possible. Induction is traditionally con- trasted with deduction: in deduction you can guarantee that the conclusions are correct; in induction all bets are off. Or such was the conventional wisdom for many centuries. One of the major developments of recent decades has been the realization that in fact we can have guarantees on the re- sults of induction, particularly if we’re willing to settle for probabilistic guarantees. The basic argument is remarkably simple [5]. Let’s say a classifier is bad if its true error rate is greater than ?. Then the probability that a bad classifier is consistent with n ran- dom, independent training examples is less than (1??)n. Let b be the number of bad classifiers in the learner’s hy- pothesis space H. The probability that at least one of them is consistent is less than b(1??)n, by the union bound. Assuming the learner always returns a consistent classifier, the probability that this classifier is bad is then less than |H|(1??)n, where we have used the fact that b?|H|. So if we want this probability to be less than ?, it suffices to make n > ln(?/|H|)/ln(1??)? 1? parenleftbigln|H|+ln 1?parenrightbig. Unfortunately, guarantees of this type have to be taken with a large grain of salt. This is because the bounds obtained in this way are usually extremely loose. The wonderful feature of the bound above is that the required number of examples only grows logarithmically with|H|and 1/?. Unfortunately, most interesting hypothesis spaces are doubly exponential in the number of features d, which still leaves us needing a num- ber of examples exponential in d. For example, consider the space of Boolean functions of d Boolean variables. If there are e possible different examples, there are 2e possible dif- ferent functions, so since there are 2d possible examples, the total number of functions is 22d. And even for hypothesis spaces that are“merely”exponential, the bound is still very loose, because the union bound is very pessimistic. For ex- ample, if there are 100 Boolean features and the hypothesis space is decision trees with up to 10 levels, to guarantee ? = ? = 1% in the bound above we need half a million ex- amples. But in practice a small fraction of this suffices for accurate learning. Further, we have to be careful about what a bound like this means. For instance, it does not say that, if your learner returned a hypothesis consistent with a particular training set, then this hypothesis probably generalizes well. What it says is that, given a large enough training set, with high probability your learner will either return a hypothesis that generalizes well or be unable to find a consistent hypothesis. The bound also says nothing about how to select a good hy- pothesis space. It only tells us that, if the hypothesis space contains the true classifier, then the probability that the learner outputs a bad classifier decreases with training set size. If we shrink the hypothesis space, the bound improves, but the chances that it contains the true classifier shrink also. (There are bounds for the case where the true classi- fier is not in the hypothesis space, but similar considerations apply to them.) Another common type of theoretical guarantee is asymp- totic: given infinite data, the learner is guaranteed to output the correct classifier. This is reassuring, but it would be rash to choose one learner over another because of its asymptotic guarantees. In practice, we are seldom in the asymptotic regime (also known as “asymptopia”). And, because of the bias-variance tradeoff we discussed above, if learner A is bet- ter than learner B given infinite data, B is often better than A given finite data. The main role of theoretical guarantees in machine learning is not as a criterion for practical decisions, but as a source of understandingand driving force for algorithmdesign. In this capacity, they are quite useful; indeed, the close interplay of theory and practice is one of the main reasons machine learning has made so much progress over the years. But caveat emptor: learning is a complex phenomenon, and just because a learner has a theoretical justification and works in practice doesn’t mean the former is the reason for the latter. 8. FEATURE ENGINEERING IS THE KEY At the end of the day, some machine learning projects suc- ceed and some fail. What makes the difference? Easily the most important factor is the features used. If you have many independent features that each correlate well with the class, learning is easy. On the other hand, if the class is a very complex function of the features, you may not be able to learn it. Often, the raw data is not in a form that is amenable to learning, but you can construct features from it that are. This is typically where most of the effort in a ma- chine learning project goes. It is often also one of the most interesting parts, where intuition, creativity and“black art” are as important as the technical stuff. First-timers are often surprised by how little time in a ma- chine learning project is spent actually doing machine learn- ing. But it makes sense if you consider how time-consuming

Analitica Scand. J. of Economics 0;(1(3), 383-413, 1988 The Basic Analytics ofMoral Hazard· RichardJ. Amo/t Boston College. Chestnut Hill. MA, USA and Queen's University. Kingston. ONT. Canada Joseph E. SliglilZ Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA Abstract The basic analyti" of moral haurd are developed using the simplest possible model of th.e insurance market. Even when the underlying expected utility function and the function relating the accident probability to accident-prevention effort are extremely well behaved, the indifference curves and feasibility set (the set of insurance contracts which at least break even) are not - indifferent<' curves r>eed not be convex ar>d feasibility sets never are; price  and income-oonsumption lines may be discontinuous; and effort is not in general a mono  tonic or continuous function of the parameters of the insurance policies provided. I. Introduction In the standard (Arrow·Oebreu) competitive treatment of risk. the states of nature, which occur with exogenous probabilities, are observable. Insurance contingent on the realized state entails lump-sum transfers across states and therefore has no incentive or substitution effects. Moral hazard arises when neither the states of nature nor individuals' actions are observable 10 an insurer,l What is observable is whether a particular accident has occurred. Under these conditions, there is no mechanism by which the insurer can induce the insured to reveal either the state of nature or his level of precaution truthfully. Thus, the insured  against events are accidents of varying degrees of severity, conditional on neither the state of nature nor the insured's actions. The provision of 'We would like to thank Seppo Honkapohja and two anonymoos referees for useful comments, and the National Science Foondation. the Olin Foundation. and the Social Sciences and Humanities Re;earch Council of Canada for linancial suppon. I This is the extreme fonn of moral hazard. Moral hazard probleTrn arise, although they are diluted. when the S!ates of nature and/or individuals' actions are imperfectly ob!iervable (observable with noise). 1The provision ofinsurance therefore affects the probabilities of the events. For this reason. we define moral hazard to arise when the provision of insurant<' affects tile probabilities of the insured-against events. 384 R. 1. AmottandJ. E. Stiglitz. insurance against such events will generally affect the individual's incentives to take precautions 2 - i.e., have substitution effects. There is therefore a tradeoff between incentives and risk-bearing. This is the moral hazard problem. Moral hazard is pervasive in the economy. It occurs whenever risk is present, individuals are risk averse, and "effort" is costly to monitor. And it arises not only in insurance markets, but also when insurance is provided by governments, through social institutions, or in principal-agent con  tracts. The basic analytics of moral hazard are developed in this paper. The analysis focuses on the relationship between the insurance premium paid and the insurance benefits received in the event of an accident. We derive the properties of the indifference curves and of the feasibility set, the set of insurance contracts which at least break even. The central message of the paper is that even when the underlying functions, the expected utility function and the relationship between effort and the accident probability, are extremely well behaved, the indifference curves and feasibility sets are not - indifference curves need not be convex and feasibility sets never are; price- and income-consumption lines may be discontinuous; and effort is not in general a monotonic or continuous function of the parameters of the insurance policies provided or of the prices of goods. These resulls are established in Part I of this paper, while some of their implications are discussed in Part 2. We show that our canonical model of an insurance market can be reinterpreted to provide a model of loans with bankruptcy or of work incentives. The properties that we uncover here have profound implications for the nature and existence of competitive equilibrium. We illustrate some ofthese. J Part I. Basic Analytics 11. The Model Throughout most of the paper we employ the simplest model in which moral hazard is present. Each individual in the economy engages in a single activity that has two possible outcomes, which we refer toa.~ "accident" and "00 accidem".4 The output of the economy is a consump  tion good which is the only good in the economy. An individuaJ's level of output (his consumption or income in the absence of insurance) depends }Becau".e of space limitations. we provide a thorough analysis of the nature and existence of competitive e<luilibrium in a companion paper; see Amon andStiglitzl1987a~ 'The two outcomes may instead be interpreted as "large damage conditional on an accident oceurring" and "small damage conditional on an accident occurring." St-and. J. ofEa""'mic3 1988 The basic analytic! ofmoral hazard 385 on whether or not an accident happens to him. The probability of an individual having an accident is a function of his accident-prevention effort,S and different individuals' accident probabilities are statisticaUy independent, To isolate the phenomena arising from moral hazard {from those which would arise if there were adverse selection as well}, we assume that individuals are identical. Alternatively, we could assume that insurers can observe all the relevant characteristics of the insured (except, of course, effort), and interpret our analysis as applying to a group with the same characteristics. Because they are risk averse, individuals will want to insure against the accident. We assume that whoever provides the insurance can observe whether the accident has occurred, but neither the underlying states of nature nor individuals' effort levels - this is the informational asymmetry which gives rise to the moral hazard problem. Thus, insurance is provided against the accident. As more insurance is provided, the marginal private benefit 10 the individual of expending a given level of effort on accident prevention falls; as a result, he will tend to expend less effort which will increase the probability of his having an accident. We denote by Yo and Yt consumption in the events no accident and accident, respectively. In the absence of insurance Yo-W Yt=w-d, where w is the no-accident output and d the damage due to the accident, so that w - d is the accident output. We characterize an insurance policy in terms of a net (of premium) payout or benefit a, which the individual receives in the event of accident, and a premium, fJ, which the individual pays if an accident does notoccur.~Thus, with insurance Yo"'w-fJ and Yl '*w-d+a. (la,b) The probability, p, that an accident happens to an individual is a func  tion of his level of (accident-prevention) effort, e. At some points in the paper, we assume that the individual has a choice of only a discrete number of effort levels, each corresponding to a different accident-preven  tion activity or technique. In this case, effort need not be quantified. We denote by pi the probability of accident when effort level j is chosen, and by p the probability of accident when nothing is done to prevent the 'Our analysis is sufficienlly general that effort may be interpreted variously as exertion. the time spenl in accident-prevenlioo activity, the nature (unpleasantness) of the accident  prevention activity undertaken. and (for some utility functions) units of tile consumption good used up in accident prevention. • This c<.>rre:sp<:mds 10 an insurance policy with ppayable in both events, and a gross payout in the event ofaccident of a +p. .w>Ui.

At other points in the paper, we assume that the individual has a choice over a continuum of effort levels. We assume that more effort always reduces the probability of accident and does so in a continuous manner, and we cardinalize effort in such a way that e= 0 with zero effort and p( e) is strictly convex and anaJytic for e>O. Thus, p'( e) <0 and pOle}> 0 for e> O. For this case, too, we assume that p(O)·P< 1. We refer to p{e} as the probability-of-accident function. The individuaJ's expected utility is (2,) in the discrete effort levels case, whereU~is the individuaJ's utility func· tion with effort j if an accident does not occur, and U I I the corresponding utility function when an accident does occur. In the continuum of effort levels case, expected utility is EU "'(I - p(e)) Uc(Yo,e} +pie) Ul{YI,e). (2b) We assume that (auJayJ >0 and (a 2Udal)<0, i - 0, 1; i.e., in each event and for every effort level, there is positive but diminishing marginal utility of consumption.

In much of the subsequent analysis, it will prove insightful to focus on certain restricted classes of utility functions. Sometimes we treat expected utility functions of the form (2,') in the discrete effort levels case, and (2b') in the continuum of effort levels case, We refer to these as separable expected utility functions. Note that to go from (2a) to (2a') and from (2h) to (2b') requires three assumptions: first, that utility in both events is strongly separable in consumption and effort; second, that the disutility of , We allow the individual IQmi~activities on the assumptioo that where A.ii!; the proportion of"time" he devotes IQ ac<'ident-prevention activity j.

For part of the analysis, we go further and assume that the utility-of-consumption function is also event independent, that is uo( y} - u 1 ( y) for all y. The general theory requires. of course, neither the assumption of separability nor that of event·independence. Our objective is to show that even with these strong assumptions, the indifference curves and feasibility set will not be well behaved. Unless specified othetwise, we assume separability. We consider some of the complications that arise with nonseparable utility in Sections V and VII. Ill.

February 2003 File: ED 18 Business Intelligence, Data Integration, and Analytics: Keep It Simple, Keep It Flexible Executive Directions Doug Lynn FOCAL POINT As increasingly popular informational applications, business intelligence (BI) tools (e.g., query, production reporting, online analytical processing [OLAP]) and analytics (e.g., yield-management performance, consolidated financial statements) open up a chasm of credibility change potential, both good and bad. Such tools can become unmanageably expensive and problematic to ensure consistent performance, as users’ evolving needs demand more data and more applications over time. This application classification consumes technical infrastructure (e.g., servers, storage, network, DBMS) very differently (e.g., 10x-100x the data volume, network bandwidth) from how equivalent transactional systems do (e.g., online order entry, customer information systems). Data quality drives overall BI tool and analytics quality, requiring extensive transactional system and integration knowledge that may be difficult to find and fund. BI tools and analytics are typically bolted on to standalone transactional systems, creating information silos that do not necessarily integrate easily to provide cross-enterprise views of business performance. Left unaddressed, these issues cause large cost overruns as well as low-quality and low-performing BI tools and analytics, a situation that compromises IT organization (ITO) credibility — something that IT executives seek to avoid every day. Going forward, high- performing IT executives will rely on sound (application and infrastructure) architecture principles, simplicity in design, and “less than bleeding-edge” technology to flexibly respond to users’ evolving needs while performing within cost, quality, and time constraints. CONTEXT BI, data integration (DI), and analytics technologies provide high value visibility (increasingly in near-real-time intervals) into an enterprise’s performance or output (e.g., product/service orders, channel output, unstructured knowledge retention, employee performance) and outcome (e.g., market position, customer satisfaction, balance sheet) through access to and processing of data stored and managed within transactional systems (e.g., order entry, accounting, logistics, manufacturing, supply chain — see Figure 1). However, over time, users’ informational needs evolve, requiring more and different data, higher query complexity, and broader reporting functionality. Such changes are expensive, take time to implement, and place significant strain on ITO processes and personnel if not adequately provisioned. During 2003/04, BI, data integration, and analytics will evolve into more information-focused tools, concentrating on business value rather than technological prowess. By 2004, comprehensive information delivery and analysis architectures will become available, delivering unstructured and structured information through enterprise portals. Through 2006, further integration (e.g., enterprise application vendors embedding analytic tool engines into their suites) will enable optimization of customer-related business processes and data quality, thereby introducing a degree of “information sprawl” control. Therefore, it is not surprising that successful BI and analytics systems (e.g., timely delivery of higher-quality data and information with lower cost) are the result of extensive investment in technology, process, policy, and competence. ITOs that enjoy success with BI and analytics have determined the correct mix of development, operations, and maintenance processes and requisite human capital (e.g., skill, experience, META Trend: Understanding the key IT trends, their business impact on both tactical operations and strategic goals, and how to actualize that impact is critical to addressing the current top CIO issue: business/IT alignment. Throughout 2003/04, the internally focused portfolio of technologies currently being integrated by CIOs will include integration (i.e., portals, enterprise application integration), integrated development environments (.Net/J2EE), information management/analytics, and security. 208 Harbor Drive  Stamford, CT 06912-0061  (203) 973-6700  Fax (203) 359-8066  metagroup.com File: ED Practice 18 Copyright © 2003 META Group, Inc. All rights reserved. 2 expertise) to address this challenge, by first understanding the fundamental technology issues around this application type. Business Intelligence BI technologies implement varied approaches to turning transactional data into information, each with natural reliability, availability, serviceability, and scalability constraints/options to consider: • Query tools read data via a structured query language (SQL) access method from a relational database management system (RDBMS). Query data is extracted from transactional applications and structured for read, not update, performance. BI tools typically need some type of data integration services to gather, transform/cleanse, and load data from transactional systems. • Production reporting tools read data directly from transactional system databases or file systems (when such systems are typically in offline mode) via a SQL or native systems access method (e.g., IMS DB/DC, VSAM). In their simplest terms, production reporting tools are query tools that offer more granular formatting and layout features. • OLAP tools have more granular processing functionality than do query and production reporting tools. OLAP technology is a combination of sophisticated query processing and complex data structures (e.g., hierarchical views across which users navigate up and down dimensions such as financial reporting periods, geographies, and bills of material). Because this category of BI tools can handle more users, data, and workloads, it has a larger infrastructure (e.g., servers, storage, DBMS, network) impact (and thus cost and management requirements) than do query and production reporting tools. • All these tools typically offer some form of thin-client functionality, portal, and management console. As a $4.55 billion market in 2002, BI spending — driven by enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) reporting, extranet reporting, and enterprise portal (EP) deployments — will grow 25% annually, at least through 2005/06. Starting in 2003, BI tool suites will begin to evolve into information delivery platforms capable of supporting internal and inter-enterprise analytical applications, structured and unstructured information, delivered through enterprise portals. By 2003/04, most ITOs will deploy user audit tools to come to grips with the BI “shelfware” problem (see WCS Delta 1105). During 2003/04, “integrated analytics” will become increasingly critical to BI solutions’ ongoing marketing success. Through 2003, buyer consolidation of numerous analytic implementations into enterprisewide deployments will accelerate query/reporting tool market consolidation, favoring established and specialty vendors. By 2004/05, leading BI vendors will deliver strong server-side performance, component-based analytic development, diverse output formats, solid ERP/CRM vendor relationships, collaborative/workflow decision making, and robust metadata management. By 2004/05, most BI projects will be part of an overall information delivery strategy that embraces unstructured textual information (e.g., documents, messages, discussions) accessed through EPs, making integration imperative. By 2005, integrated analytics will be the minimum ante for any Tier 1 BI vendor to survive in the analytical application market. Through 2005/06, enterprise business application vendors will embed analytic engines, stripping substantial market share from independent BI vendors. During this time frame, most large organizations will need three to six vendors for complete BI coverage. By 2006, the notion of role-based scenarios supported by automated business processes and best practices to support that role will become mission-critical to BI tool vendor success. By 2006/07, most enterprises will leverage external analytic service providers. Figure 1 — BI, DI, and Analytics Defined Source: META Group While the IT supplier community continues to blur the definitions of BI and analytics, we define BI, DI, and analytics as follows: • Business intelligence (BI): A class of software-based tools that provide query, production reporting, and OLAP services to data. This class of tools is typically used to monitor goal-based business performance output (e.g., Web site activity, sales). • Data integration: A set of technologies that gather (e.g., extract, read, copy) and prepare (e.g., transform, cleanse, aggregate) data from multiple sources and then load it into structures for consumption by BI and analytical applications and tools. • Analytics: The class of informational applications/tools that includes BI functionality to most commonly produce information that conveys a specific outcome’s impact on an organization (e.g., consolidated financial statements, customer Web site retention). 208 Harbor Drive  Stamford, CT 06912-0061  (203) 973-6700  Fax (203) 359-8066  metagroup.com File: ED Practice 18 Copyright © 2003 META Group, Inc. All rights reserved. 3 Tier 1 query tool vendors include Brio, Business Objects, Cognos, and Crystal. Tier 1 reporting vendors include Actuate, Brio, Crystal Decisions (Info), and Information Builders, whose product excels at mainframe reporting and is also available on Unix and Intel-based servers. Beginning in 2003, query and analytical tool enhancements will force traditional reporting-only vendors into offering more analytical capabilities. Tier 1 OLAP vendors include Brio, Business Objects, Cognos, Hyperion, Microsoft, MicroStrategy, and Oracle (see ADS Delta 1156). The dynamism of this market will make it problematic to comply with tool standards without sacrifice in cost, quality, or time. BI license management has become complex because the industry has moved from a two-tier client/server model, with per-user licensing, to a Web reporting and OLAP server model, with various license models (e.g., named user, concurrent, unlimited user server). Although per-user licenses are still common, we expect server-oriented models to increase in frequency and be the predominant model by 2004. By 2006, ITOs must have established BI license management teams to proactively manage these complex and costly deployments. Our research indicates that proactive management of license costs can save Global 2000 companies up to 20% of BI license costs. To minimize the negative influence of the BI market’s dynamism and remain flexible to client needs, IT executives avoid the following 10 common pitfalls (see WCS 1143): Planning and Strategy 1. No BI standards. This can result in significant savings by reducing support costs and combining purchases (see WCS Delta 992). 2. “One vendor fits all” syndrome results in functional compromises, unhappy users, and breakdowns in standards governance, as end users demand solutions to problems for which the standard tool is unsuitable. ITOs should choose standards in three categories (see WCS Delta 1005): enterprise reporting, ad hoc query and analysis, and OLAP servers. 3. Failure to coordinate with the EP team duplicates effort and wastes money and time. 4. Reporting from bad data will ensure that bad decisions are made quickly — clearly, a wrong approach. An overall data architecture is needed to ensure adequate data quality and accurate reporting of business metrics. 5. Enterprise application analysis paralysis. IT groups must realize that enterprise application BI suites cannot solve all BI problems. Organizations must still select BI standards (i.e., query/analysis, production reporting, and OLAP) and leverage connectivity to users’ ERP and CRM packages (see WCS Deltas 982, 992, and 1005). Ongoing Deployment Management Issues 6. Underestimation of systems management requirements places unforeseen, significant work on the ITO. CIOs should expect one to two full-time equivalents per 100 users for management of ad hoc query and analysis deployments (e.g., Cognos, Brio, Business Objects). 7. No end-user support group. Despite the convincing influence of vendor references and marketing messages, IT executives should plan to provide training, help-desk support, and a report development team. 8. License management. As BI deployments rise in proportion to the ITO’s budget, IT executives should be careful to control license agreement negotiations (particularly server licenses) such that an allocation balance can be struck between individual and server-based deployments. As unlimited-user server licenses become the predominant licensing model (2003/04), BI licensing groups must be established to track license use. Managing the BI Portfolio 9. No user auditing. Without BI tool usage auditing, vendor license, service. and support charges become untenable. By 2004/05, most BI systems will be accessed through EPs, and BI-specific utilization management will merge with EP usage analysis tools. 10. No sunset strategy. The lack of a sunset strategy (e.g., retiring old BI resources) will ensure continuous expansion of an increasingly (and inconsistently used) BI portfolio. IT executives should have a scheduled process to review usage and to plan retirement activities. 208 Harbor Drive  Stamford, CT 06912-0061  (203) 973-6700  Fax (203) 359-8066  metagroup.com File: ED Practice 18 Copyright © 2003 META Group, Inc. All rights reserved. 4 In addition to the avoiding the 10 business intelligence pitfalls, IT executives should also do the following: • Establish BI tool evaluation criteria, filtering out overlapping production functionality and confusing differentiation, including vendor viability, required functionality, ease of use/management, back-end connectivity, and user target (e.g., Inter/intra/extranet; see WCS Deltas 982 and 992). • Manage the deployment to offset specialized systems management challenges (e.g., management of database connections, metadata, data security, and user report/model development) imposed by large BI tool deployments. Handling these issues requires budgeting, support staff training, and cooperation with corporate security and EP groups (see WCS Delta 1182). • Look to analytic solutions from enterprise reporting vendors to help drive the consolidation of multiple query and analysis tools that have propagated over time or through packaged application acquisition (see ADS Delta 1096). • Establish BI user categories to buffer vendor pressure to provide high-end functionality to all users, regardless of job role, and to provide cost, quality, and value balance by categorizing users based on role or information needs and appropriate tools (see WCS Delta 110). Data Integration DI (a.k.a. analytic infrastructure, information mover infrastructure, DI) is a complementary and essential component to BI and analytics tools and applications, providing data extraction, transformation, movement, and loading (ETML) of transactional data into informational databases. DI technology forms a middleware link between transactional databases with data marts, enterprise data warehouses (EDWs), and operational data stores. Data marts are typically created to answer known questions of a specific nature. EDWs exist to provide a single image of the truth about an entity (e.g., partners, employees, customers, suppliers) and to be a staging area for one or more data marts. EDWs typically cost approximately $1 million annually, with no end users ever directly touching this data structure. Operational data stores are designed for near-real-time transactional data queries with little to no data cleansing. There are several choices in each step of the ETML process to consider, each having natural reliability, availability, serviceability, and scalability constraints/options. Data extraction technology offers three choices of data access (e.g., SQL, application-level interface, native DBMS, file system utility; see SIS Delta 1017) in transactional databases, transaction logs, asynchronous (transaction) message queues, etc. or while such databases are online or shut down for batch processing needs. Connectors to commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) applications are increasingly used to simplify the configuration and operation of reading data from these applications’ databases. Data transformation tools for informational application usage typically use a batch process to convert, integrate, merge, and purge extracted transactional data files into a format that is clear, clean, and prepared for query, analysis, and OLAP-type processing. This class of software tool has unique performance capabilities (e.g., set-at-a-time vs. record-at-a-time processing) to consider, mostly from a throughput perspective and user exits to call external programs to boost output quality or quantity. Data movement tools offer multiple choices to move data from source (transactional) systems to and through the transformation process to other processes, and finally to target (informational) databases. Performance is heavily dependent on drivers like network traffic, file size, and file quantity through several choices, including direct (SQL) access, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), message/queuing (MQ), database replication, gateways, and distributed data management. Loading technology supplied by the database vendor (e.g., Oracle, IBM, MSFT) is primarily done when application-based approaches take too long or are too expensive. In 2003, organizations will begin to blend analytic architectures (e.g., line-of-business data marts, application- independent data warehouses) to enhance inter/intra-business collaboration, and share infrastructure costs. During 2003/04, leading DBMS vendor ETL offerings will become viable for enterprise-class DWs and place debilitating price pressure on established leaders. Through 2004/05, most organizations will reassess their current analytic infrastructure to improve overall analytic agility and reduce IT-related costs. ITOs will lead this movement by spurning data-mart-only strategies, opting instead for more normalized EDWs. Initially, designers will see this as a move to improve data quality. By 2005/06, ETL technologies will become decidedly componentized, with data access logic, data transformation logic, data load logic, and scheduling integrated from leaders in those technology areas. Through 2005/06, ETML tools will remain the primary mechanism for populating EDWs and data marts. Starting first with hub-and-spoke architectures, ITOs will begin the transition to a pure EDW (2005/06) to simplify the analytic infrastructure (fewer marts to manage) and reduce data movement requirements. 208 Harbor Drive  Stamford, CT 06912-0061  (203) 973-6700  Fax (203) 359-8066  metagroup.com File: ED Practice 18 Copyright © 2003 META Group, Inc. All rights reserved. 5 By 2006, designers will emphasize flexibility (e.g., the ability to add new subjects/items or have unlimited queries) over performance (end-user response time) as performance continues to rise in importance and is addressed on an as-needed basis through clustered DBMS, “parallelized” ETML processes and more judicious use of data marts. Through 2006, technology advances (e.g., InfiniBand, SANs, scale-out DBMS support, powerful commodity servers) will address many of the performance issues that DW designers currently face. In addition, software vendors will continue to improve parallel processing, which will facilitate the continued building of massive EDWs. By 2006, physical DW designs will heavily favor a more centralized enterprise data store (vs. data marts) as a means of reducing analytic infrastructure complexity (i.e., data movement/transformation) and data latency, as well as to simplify maintenance. Through 2006/07, ETML tools will evolve independently of, though inspired by enterprise application integration (EAI), technologies, to support increasing volumes, velocities, and variety of data sources. Through 2007/08, data integration/ETML vendors will begin offering self-optimizing solutions for accessing, caching, and persistently warehousing data — focusing greatly on linking unstructured content to structured transaction/account data. A recent META Group survey indicated that DI is the greatest architectural challenge relating to BI and analytics and is 4x more difficult to do than respondents had expected. As a popular workaround to performance constraints, hand-coding ETML logic may be appropriate for some small, targeted solutions, but it is hardly satisfactory for enterprise analytics. By overemphasizing performance, many ITOs have experienced an explosion in the number of data marts, with a corresponding reduction in flexibility, as each instance relies on custom code for performance. Although this approach works, it creates an infrastructure that is unmanageable and expensive to respond to each incremental service demand (typical of informational applications). To get on the right DI track (e.g., flexible, predictable response to dynamic information needs), CIOs should do the following: • Reduce the amount of information systems data that is being moved. Every time data is moved, it incurs a real cost and not necessarily any value. Therefore, data should be moved only at the right time, quality (speed), and cost. • Keep the analytic architecture simple; sacrifice data-mart-only strategies for more normalized EDWs. CIOs should get the right data first, then process it quickly second (see SIS Delta 970). • Until self-tuning and self-organizing DBMS technology is broadly available, users should map their data integration needs into one of five distinct patterns (i.e., database replication, ETML, EAI, information logistics, enterprise information integration [EII]), each with unique volume, latency, transformation, and integration capabilities). Users properly classifying their data integration requirements before selecting solutions are better poised to meet overall business objectives (see ADS Delta 1070). • Avoid data warehouse program management pitfalls (e.g., no usage tracking, low IT DW personnel retention, lack of business-level metadata, lack of change management policy) that raise end-user questions about the ongoing investment’s real value (see SIS Delta 973). • Refrain from automatically gravitating toward one of the ETML leaders. In many cases, one of the lesser- known alternatives can address particular environmental or project factors (see ADS Delta 1141). • Consider an ETML tool that delivers more granular functionality and performance to rein in rogue DW efforts into a more enterprise-oriented analytic solution (see ADS Delta 1140). • Build an analytic architecture that increasingly supports larger user communities, incorporates a greater variety of information sources, accommodates robust analytic functions, and is adequately scalable and flexible to handle emerging analytic requirements requires (see ADS Delta 1139). • Use portfolio management to determine the balance between data mart expansion/consolidation vs. an EDW (see ADS Delta 1100). • Keep the analytic infrastructure simple. Simplicity in infrastructure helps organizations to better meet the growing demand for analytic data (see SIS Delta 970). • Model applications and data structures to reflect the business, not a predefined set of known questions. From a physical layer, ODSs and EDWs should be collapsed, with current data stored in separate tables or flagged to indicate the current record. From a logical layer, database views should be used to perform preaggregation, derive columns, include joins and indexes, etc. • Understand the analytic infrastructure components (e.g., data marts, EDWs, operational data stores, ETML process) to best design, staff, and run the underlying infrastructure to support all informational applications, regardless of data requirements (see SIS Delta 958).

Describe how database technologies and methods as part of business intelligence/business analytics improve decision-making. ? Describe Web intelligence/Web analytics and their importance to organizations. Many organizations have amassed vast amounts of data that employees use to unlock valuable secrets to enable the organization compete successfully. Some organizations do this extremely well, but others are quite ineffective.To use analytic tools to improve organizational decision-making, a foundational data architecture and enterprise archi- tecture must be in place to facilitate effective decision analysis. Enabling decision analysis through access to all relevant information is known as business intelligence. Business intelligence includes data warehousing, online analytical processing, data mining, and visualization and multidimensionality. The outline of this chapter is as follows: 5.1 Opening Vignette: Information Sharing a Principal Component of the National Strategy for Homeland Security, 5.2 The Nature and Sources of Data 5.3 Data Collection, Problems, and Quality 5.4 The Web/Internet and Commercial Database Services 5.5 Database Management Systems in Decision-Support Systems/Business Intelligence 5.6 Database Organization and Structures 5.7 Data Warehousing 5.8 Data Marts 5735ch05.qxd_lbIII  1/22/04  2:06 PM  Page 211 212 PART II DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS 5.9 Business Intelligence/Business Analytics 5.10 Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) 5.11 Data Mining 5.12 Data Visualization, Multidimensionality, and Real-Time Analytics 5.13 Geographic Information Systems 5.14 Business Intelligence and the Web: Web Intelligence/Web Analytics 5.1 OPENING VIGNETTE: INFORMATION SHARING A PRINCIPAL COMPONENT  OF THE NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR  HOMELAND SECURITY 1 1 Modified from the National Strategy for Homeland Security Web site, www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/book/index.html. Data warehouses provide a strategic data architecture to enable decision support analysis. Data warehousing enables data mining, the ability to automatically synthesize vast amounts of information in order to discover hidden truths within the data. Data portals have emerged as the next generation in Web-enabled data warehouses. One of the most significant data portals has been developed in direct response to the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. The National Strategy for Homeland Security of the United States includes a National Vision for the sharing of information related to the detection of terrorist activities. It states, We will build a national environment that enables the sharing of essential homeland security information. We must build a system of systems that can provide the right information to the right people at all times. Information will be shared “horizontally” across each level of government and “vertically” among federal, state and local governments, private industry and citizens. With the proper use of people, processes, and technology, homeland security officials throughout the United States can have complete and common awareness of threats and vulnerabilities as well as knowledge of the person- nel and resources available to address these threats. Officials will receive the information they need so they can anticipate threats and respond rapidly and effectively. The goal of the project is to create a workable model for integrating knowledge that resides across many disparate data sources, while ensuring that privacy and civil liberties are adequately safeguarded. The five major initiatives that are identified within the strategy include: 1. To integrate information sharing across the federal government 2. To extend the integration of information sharing across state and local govern- ments, private industry, and citizens 3. To adopt common metadata standards of electronic information relevant to homeland security 4. To improve public safety communication 5. To ensure reliable public health information. 5735ch05.qxd_lbIII  1/22/04  2:06 PM  Page 212 CHAPTER 5 DATA WAREHOUSING, ACQUISITION, MINING, BUSINESS ANALYLTICS AND VISUALIZATION 213 These goals can only be accomplished if there is a means to facilitate the sharing of information among numerous agencies that currently maintain independent data silos. Border security alone engages eleven agencies. For the entire data warehouse project, approximately 80 percent of the architecture will be in place in 18 months, while the complete implementation will phase in over three to five years. Ultimately the data warehouse will lead to increased security for the United States. It will be a model for how all countries can interact to protect their borders and ensure the safety of their cit- izenry. This ambitious project is not without challenges. For example, data will need to be mined from immigration records, treasury records (dealing with the exchange of large sums of money), and FBI (criminal) records. The data exist in different formats and data types; a major effort is underway to establish a means to link and search through these data to identify potential threats and crimes. ? QUESTIONS FOR THE OPENING VIGNETTE 1. Identify the challenges faced by the Office of Homeland Security in integrating disparate databases. 2. Identify the sources of information that will be required to make the information in this data portal useful. 3. What are the expected benefits? 4. Identify decisions supported by this data portal. 5. What decision support tools and techniques can be used to identify potential ter- rorist activities? 6. What would you recommend to the Office of Homeland Security to improve the capabilities of this data portal? 5.2 THE NATURE AND SOURCES OF DATA In order to understand a situation, a decision-maker needs data, information, and knowledge. These must be integrated and organized in a manner that makes them use- ful. Then the decision-maker must be able to apply analysis tools (online analytical processing (OLAP), data mining, etc.) so that the data, information, and knowledge can be utilized to full benefit. These analysis tools fall under the general heading of business intelligence (BI) and business analytics (BA) (see Chapters 3 and 4). New tools allow decision-makers and analysts to readily identify relationships among data items that enable understanding and provide a competitive advantage. For example, a customer-relationship (resource) management (CRM) system allows managers to bet- ter understand their customers. They can then determine a likely candidate for a par- ticular product or service at a specific price (see Chapter 8). Marketing efforts are improved and sales are maximized. All enterprise information systems (e.g., CRM, executive information systems, content-management systems, revenue management systems, enterprise resource planning/enterprise resource management systems, supply chain management systems, knowledge management systems) utilize database man- agement systems, data warehouses, OLAP, and data mining as their foundation (see Chapters 8 and 9). These business intelligence/business analytic (and Web intelli- gence/Web analytic) tools enable the modern enterprise to compete successfully. In the right hands, these tools provide great decision-makers with great capabilities. For example, see Case Application 5.2, which indicates how a firm developed and then uti- lized databases in an extremely competitive manner. 5735ch05.qxd_lbIII  1/22/04  2:06 PM  Page 213 214 PART II DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS The U.S. government plans to apply analytic technolo- gies on a global scale in the war on terrorism, but will they prove an effective weapon? In the first year and a half after September 11, 2001, supermarket chains, home improvement stores, and others voluntarily handed over massive amounts of customer records to federal law enforcement agencies, almost always in vio- lation of their stated privacy policies. Many others responded to court orders for information, as required by law. The government has a right to gather corporate data under legislation passed after September 11, 2001. The FBI now mines enormous amounts of data looking for activity that could indicate a terrorist plot or crime. Transaction data are where law-enforcement agencies expect to find results. American businesses are stuck in the middle. Some have to create special systems to generate the data required by law-enforcement agen- cies. An average-size company will spend an average of $5 million for a system. On the other hand, not comply- ing can cost more. Western Union was fined $8 million in December 2002 for not complying properly. Privacy issues abound. Since the government is acquiring personal data to detect suspicious patterns of activity, there is the prospect of abuse and illegal use of the data. There may be significant privacy costs involved. There are major problems with violating peo- ple’s freedoms and rights. There is a need for an over- sight organization to “watch the watchers.” The DHS must not mindlessly acquire data. It should only acquire pertinent data and information that can be mined to identify patterns that potentially could lead to stopping terrorist activities.

These data must be integrated in a data warehouse and analyzed automatically via data-mining tools or by analysts using OLAP tools. Of course, abuses can occur in the process of collecting and utilizing such a massive amount of data (see DSS in Focus 5.1). The impact of tracking data and then exploiting them for competitive advantage can be enormous. Entire industries, such as travel, banking, and all successful e-com- merce ventures, rely totally on their data and information content to flourish.

An MSS application processes data items so that the results are meaningful for an intended action or decision. • Knowledge. Knowledge consists of data items and/or information organized and processed to convey understanding, experience, accumulated learning, and exper- tise that are applicable to a current problem or activity. Knowledge can be the application of data and information in making a decision. (See Chapters 9 and 10.) MSS data can include documents, pictures, maps, sound, video, and animation. These data can be stored and organized in different ways before and after use. They also include concepts, thoughts, and opinions. Data can be raw or summarized. Many MSS applications use summary or extracted data that come from three primary sources: internal, external, and personal. INTERNAL DATA Internal data are stored in one or more places. These data are about people, products, services, and processes. For example, data about employees and their pay are usually stored in the corporate database. Data about equipment and machinery can be stored in the maintenance department database. Sales data can be stored in several places: aggregate sales data in the corporate database, and details at each region’s database. An MSS can use raw data as well as processed data (e.g., reports and summaries). Internal data are available via an organization’s intranet or other internal network. EXTERNAL DATA There are many sources of external data. They range from commercial databases to data collected by sensors and satellites. Data are available on CDs and DVDs, on the Internet, as films and photographs, and as music or voices. Government reports and files are a major source of external data, most of which are available on the Web today (e.g., see www.ftc.gov, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission). External data may also be available by using GIS (geographic information systems, see Section 5.13), from fed- eral census bureaus, and other demographic sources that gather data either directly from customers or from data suppliers. Chambers of commerce, local banks, research institutions, and the like, flood the environment with data and information, resulting in information overload for the MSS user. Data can come from around the globe. Most external data are irrelevant to a specific MSS. Yet many external data must be moni- tored and captured to ensure that important items are not overlooked.

Hand Abstract. A great many tools have been developed for supervised clas- sification, ranging from early methods such as linear discriminant anal- ysis through to modern developments such as neural networks and sup- port vector machines. A large number of comparative studies have been conducted in attempts to establish the relative superiority of these methods. This paper argues that these comparisons often fail to take into account important aspects of real problems, so that the apparent superiority of more sophisticated methods may be something of an illu- sion. In particular, simple methods typically yield performance almost as good as more sophisticated methods, to the extent that the difference in performance may be swamped by other sources of uncertainty that generally are not considered in the classical supervised classification paradigm. Key words and phrases: Supervised classification, error rate, misclas- sification rate, simplicity, principle of parsimony, population drift, se- lectivity bias, flat maximum effect, problem uncertainty, empirical com- parisons. 1. INTRODUCTION In supervised classification, one seeks to construct a rulewhich will allow oneto assign objects to one of a prespecified set of classes based solely on a vector of measurements taken on those objects. Construc- tion of the rule is based on a “design set” or “train- ing set” of objects with known measurement vectors and for which the true class is also known: one essen- tially tries to extract from the design set the infor- mation which is relevant to distinguishing between the classes in terms of the given measurements. It is because the classes are known for the members David J.

This reprint differs from the original in pagination and typographic detail. of this initial data set that the term “supervised” is used: it is as if a “supervisor” has provided these class labels. Such problems are ubiquitous and, as a conse- quence, have been tackled in several different re- search areas, including statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational learning theory and data mining. As a result, a tremendous vari- ety of algorithms and models has been developed for the construction of such rules. A partial list in- cludes linear discriminant analysis, quadratic dis- criminant analysis, regularized discriminant analy- sis, the naive Bayes method, logistic discriminant analysis, perceptrons, neural networks, radial ba- sis function methods, vector quantization methods, nearest neighbor and kernel nonparametric meth- ods, tree classifiers such as CART and C4.5, sup- port vector machines and rule-based methods. New methods, new variants on existing methods and new algorithms for existing methods are being developed all the time. In addition, different methods for vari- able selection, handling missing values and other aspects of data preprocessing multiply the number 1 2 D. J. HAND of tools yet further. General theoretical advances have also been made which have resulted in im- proved performance at predicting the class of new objects. These include ideas such as bagging, boost- ing and more general ensemble classifiers. Further- more, apart from the straightforward development of new rules, theory and practice have been devel- oped for performance assessment. A variety of crite- ria have been investigated, including measures based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Brier score, as well as the standard measure of mis- classification rate. Subtle estimators of these have been developed, such as jackknife, cross-validation and a variety of bootstrap methods, to overcome the potential optimistic bias which results from simply reclassifying the design set. An examination of recent conference proceedings and journal articles shows that such developments are continuing. In part this is because of new compu- tational developments that permit the exploration of new ideas, and in part it is because of the emer- gence of new application domains which present new twists on the standard problem. For example, in bioinformatics there are often relatively few cases but many thousands of variables. In such situations the risk of overfitting is substantial and new classes of tools are required. General references to work on supervised classification include [11, 13, 33, 38, 44]. The situation to date thus appears to be one of very substantial theoretical progress, leading to deep theoretical developments and to increased predictive power in practical applications. While all of these things are true, it is the contention of this paper that the practical impact of the developments has been inflated; that although progress has been made, it may well not be as great as has been suggested. The arguments for this assertion are described in the fol- lowing sections. They develop ideas introduced by Hand [12, 14, 15, 18, 19] and Jamain and Hand [24]. The essence of the argument is that the improve- ments attributed to the more advanced and recent developments are small, and that aspects of real practical problems often render such small differ- ences irrelevant, or even unreal, so that the gains re- ported on theoretical grounds, or on empirical com- parisons from simulated or even real data sets, do not translate into real advantages in practice. That is, progress is far less than it appears. These ideas are described in four steps. First, model-fitting is a sequential process of pro- gressive refinement, which begins by describing the largest and most striking aspects of the data struc- ture, and then turns to progressively smaller aspects (stopping, one hopes, before the process begins to model idiosyncrasies of the observed sample of data rather than aspects of the true underlying distribu- tion). In Section 2 we show that this means that the large gains in predictive accuracy in classification are won using relatively simple models at the start of the process, leaving potential gains which decrease in size as the modeling process is taken further. All of this means that the extra accuracy of the more sophisticated approaches, beyond that attained by simple models, is achieved from “minor” aspects of the distributions and classification problems. Second, in Section 3 we argue that in many, per- hapsmost, real classification problems thedata points in the design set are not, in fact, randomly drawn from the same distribution as the data points to which the classifier will be applied. There are many reasons for this discrepancy, and someare illustrated. It goes without saying that statements about classi- fier accuracy based on a false assumption about the identity of the design set distribution and the dis- tribution of future points may well be inaccurate. Third, when constructing classification rules, var- ious other assumptions and choices are often made which may not be appropriate and which may give misleading impressionsof futureclassifier performance. For example, it is typically assumed that the classes are objectively defined, with no arbitrariness or un- certainty about the class labels, but this is some- times not the case. Likewise, parameters are often estimated by optimizing criteria which are not rele- vant to the real aim of classification accuracy. Such issues are described in Section 4 and, once again, it is obvious that these introduce doubts about how the claimed classifier performance will generalize to real problems. The phenomena with which we are concerned in Sections 3 and 4 are related to the phenomenon of overfitting. A model overfits when it models the de- sign sample too closely rather than modeling the dis- tribution from which this sample is drawn. In Sec- tions 3 and 4 we are concerned with situations in which the models may accurately reflect the design distributions (so they do not underfit or overfit), but where they fail to recognize that these distributions, and the apparent classification problems described, are in fact merely a single such problem drawn from a notional distribution of problems. The real aim might be to solve a rather different problem. One CLASSIFIER TECHNOLOGY 3 might thus describe the issue as one of problem un- certainty. To take a familiar example, which we do not explore in detail in this paper because it has been explored elsewhere, the relative costs of differ- ent kinds of misclassification may differ and may be unknown. A very common resolution is to assume equal costs (Jamain and Hand [24] found that most comparative studies of classification rules made this assumption) and to use straightforward error rate as the performance criterion. However, equality is but one choice, and an arbitrary one at that, and one which we suspect is in fact rarely appropriate. In assuming equal costs, one is adopting a particu- lar problem which may not be the one which is re- ally to be solved. Indeed, things are even worse than this might suggest, because relative misclassification costs may change over time. Provost and Fawcett [36] have described such situations: “Comparison of- ten is difficult in real-world environments because key parameters of the target environment are not known. The optimal cost/benefit tradeoffs and the target class priors seldom are known precisely, and often are subject to change (Zahavi and Levin [47]; Friedman and Wyatt [8]; Klinkenberg and Thorsten [29]). For example, in fraud detection we cannot ig- nore misclassification costs or the skewed class dis- tribution, nor can we assume that our estimates are precise or static (Fawcett and Provost [6]).” Moving on, our fourth argument is that classifi- cation methods are typically evaluated by report- ing their performance on a variety of real data sets. However, such empirical comparisons, while superfi- cially attractive, have major problems which are of- ten not acknowledged. In general, we suggest in Sec- tion 5 that no method will be universally superior to other methods: relative superiority will depend on the type of data used in the comparisons, the particular data sets used, the performance criterion and a host of other factors. Moreover, the relative performance will depend on the experience the per- son making the comparison has in using the meth- ods, and this experience may differ between meth- ods: researcher A may find that his favorite method is best, merely because he knows how to squeeze the best performance from this method. These various arguments together suggest that an apparent superiority in classification accuracy, ob- tained in “laboratory conditions,” may not trans- late to a superiority in real-world conditions and, in particular, the apparent superiority of highly sophis- ticated methods may be illusory, with simple meth- ods often being equally effective or even superior in classifying new data points. 2. MARGINAL IMPROVEMENTS This section demonstrates that the extra perfor- mance to be achieved by more sophisticated classifi- cation rules, beyond that attained by simple meth- ods, is small. It follows that if aspects of the classi- fication problem are not accurately described (e.g., if incorrect distributions have been used, incorrect class definitions have been adopted, inappropriate performance comparison criteria have been applied, etc.), then the reported advantage of the more so- phisticated methods may be incorrect. Later sec- tions illustrate how some inaccuracies in the clas- sification problem description can arise. 2.1 A Simple Example Statistical modelingis a sequential process in which one gradually refines the model to provide a better and better fit to the distributions from which the data were drawn.In general, the earlier stages in this process yield greater improvement in model fit than later stages. Furthermore, if one looks at the histor- ical development of classification methods, then the earlier approaches involve relatively simple struc- tures (e.g., the linear forms of linear or logistic dis- criminant analysis), while more recent approaches involve more complicated structures (e.g., the de- cision surfaces of neural networks or support vector machines). It follows that the simple approaches will have led to greater improvement in predictive per- formance than the later approaches which are nec- essarily trying to improve on the predictive perfor- mance obtained by the simpler earlier methods. Put another way, there is a law of diminishing returns. Although this paper is concerned with supervised classification problems, it is illuminating to examine a simple regression case. Suppose that we have a single response variable y which is to be predicted from d variables (x1,...,xd)T =x. Supposealso that the correlation matrix of (xT,y)T has the form ?= bracketleftbigg? 11 ?12 ?21 ?22 bracketrightbigg = bracketleftbigg(1??)I+?11T ? ?T 1 bracketrightbigg (2.1) with ?11 =(1??)I+?11T, ?12 =?T21 =? and ?22 = 1, where I is the d × d identity matrix, 1=(1,...,1)T of length d and ? = (?,...,?)T of length d. That is, the correlation between each pair 4 D. J. HAND of predictor variables is ?, and the correlation be- tween each predictor variable and the response vari- able is ?. Suppose also that ?, ? ?0. This condition is not necessary for the argument which follows; it merely allows us to avoid some detail. Let V(d) be the conditional variance of y given the values of d predictor variables x, as above. Standard results give this conditional variance as V(d)=?22 ??21??111 ?12.(2.2) Using the result that ??111 = [(1??)I+?11T]?1 (2.3) = 11?? braceleftbigg I? ?11 T 1+(d?1)? bracerightbigg [with ?(d?1)?1 <?<1, so that ?11 is positive def- inite], leads to V(d) =1??T 11?? braceleftbigg I? ?11 T 1+(d?1)? bracerightbigg ? (2.4) =1? d? 2 1?? + ?d2?2 (1+(d?1)?)(1??). From this it follows that the reduction in conditional variance due to adding an extra predictor variable, xd+1 (also correlated ? with the other predictors and ? with the response variable), is X(d+1) =V (d)?V(d+1) = ? 2 1??(2.5) + ?? 2 1?? bracketleftbigg d2 1+(d?1)? ? (d+1)2 1+d? bracketrightbigg . Note that the condition ?(d?1)?1 < ? < 1 must still be satisfied when d is increased. Now consider two cases: Case 1. When the predictor variables are uncor- related, ?=0. From (2.5), we obtain X(d+1)=?2. That is, if the predictor variables are mutually un- correlated and each has correlation ? with the re- sponse variable, then each additional predictor re- duces thevariance of theconditional variance of y given the predictors by ?2. [Of course, by setting ?=0 in (2.4) we see that this is only possible up to d=??2 predictors. With this many predictors the condi- tional variance of y given x has been reduced to zero.] Case 2. ?>0. Plots of V (d) for ? =0.5 and for a range of ? values are shown in Figure 1. When there is reasonably strong mutual correlation between the predictor variables, the earliest ones contribute sub- stantially more to the reduction in variance remain- ing unexplained than do the later ones. The case ? = 0 consists of a diagonal straight line running from 1 down to zero. In the case ?=0.9, almost all of the variance in the response variable is explained by the first chosen predictor. This example shows that the reduction in con- ditional variance of the response variable decreases with each additional predictor we add, even though each predictor has an identical correlation with the responsevariable (provided this correlation is greater than 0). The reason for the reduction is, of course, the mutual correlation between the predictors: much of the predictive power of a new predictor has al- ready been accounted for by the existing predictors. In real applications, the situation is generally even more pronounced than in this illustration. Usually, in real applications, the predictor variables are not identically correlated with the response,and thepre- dictors are selected sequentially, beginningwith those which maximally reduce the conditional variance. In a sense, then, the example above provides a lower bound on the phenomenon: in real applications the proportion of the gains attributable to the early steps is even greater. 2.2 Decreasing Bounds on Possible Improvement We now return to supervised classification. For illustrative purposes, suppose that misclassification rate is the performance criterion, although similar arguments apply with other criteria. Ignoring issues of overfitting, adding additional predictor variables can only lead to a decrease in misclassification rate. Fig. 1. Conditional variance of response variable as addi- tional predictors are added for ? =0.5. A range of values of ? is shown. CLASSIFIER TECHNOLOGY 5 The simplest model is that which uses no predictors, leading, in the two-class case, to a misclassification rate of m0 = pi0, where pi0 is the prior probability of the smaller class. Suppose that a predictor vari- able is now introduced which has the effect of re- ducing the misclassification rate to m1 <m0. Then the scope for further improvement is only m1, which is less than the original scope m0. Furthermore, if m1 < m0 ? m1, then all future additions necessar- ily improve things by less than the first predictor variable. In fact, things are even more extreme than this: one cannot further reduce the misclassification rate by more than m1 ?mb, where mb is the Bayes error rate. To put it another way, at each step the maximum possible increase in predictive power de- creases, so it is not surprising that, in general, at each step the additional contribution to predictive power decreases. 2.3 Effectiveness of Simple Classifiers Although the literature contains examples of ar- tificial data which simple models cannot separate (e.g., intertwined spirals or checkerboard patterns), such data sets are exceedingly rare in real life. Con- versely, in the two-class case, although few real data sets have exactly linear decision surfaces, it is com- mon to find that the centroids of the predictor vari- able distributions of the classes are different, so that a simple linear surface can do surprisingly well as an estimate of the true decision surface. This may not be the same as “can do surprisingly well in classify- ing the points,” since in many problems the Bayes error rate is high, meaning that no decision sur- face can separate the distributions of such problems very well. However, it means that the dramatic steps in improvement in classifier accuracy are made in the simple first steps. This is a phenomenon which has been noticed by others (e.g., Rendell and Se- shu [37]; Shavlik, Mooney and Towell [41]; Mingers [34]; Weiss, Galen and Tadepalli [45]; Holte [22]). Holte [22], in particular, carried out an investigation of this phenomenon. His “simple classifier” (called 1R) consists of a partition of a single variable, with each cell of the partition possibly being assigned to a different class: it is a multiple-split single-level tree classifier. A search through the variables is used to find that which yields the best predictive accuracy. Holte compared this simple rule with C4.5, a more sophisticated tree algorithm, finding that “on most of the datasets studied, 1R’s accuracy is about 3 percentage points lower than C4’s.” We carried out a similar analysis. Perhaps the earliest classification method formally developed is Fisher’s linear discriminantanalysis [7].Table 1 shows misclassification rates for this method and for the best performing method we could find in a search of the literature (these data were abstracted from the data accumulated by Jamain [23] and Jamain and Hand [24]) for a randomly selected sample of ten data sets. The first numerical column shows the misclassification rate of the best method we found (mT), the second shows that of linear discriminant analysis (mL), the third shows the default rule of as- signing every point to the majority class (m0) and the final column shows the proportion of the dif- ference between the default rule and the best rule which is achieved by linear discriminant analysis [(m0 ? mL)/(m0 ? mT)]. It is likely that the best rules, being the best of rules which many researchers have applied, are producing results near the Bayes error rate.

The author includes material from over 20 years of professional business expe- rience as well as a diversity of research projects he was involved in, in order to enrich the content and give an original approach to commercial data analysis. In the appendix, practical case studies derived from real-world projects are used to illustrate the concepts and techniques that are explained throughout the book. Numerous references are included for those readers who wish to go into greater depth about a given topic. Many of the methods, techniques, and ideas presented, such as data quality, data mart, customer relationship management, data sources, and Internet searches, can be applied by small business owners, freelance professionals, or medium to large-sized companies. The reader will see that it is not a pre- requisite to have large volumes of data, and many tools used for data analysis are available for a nominal cost. Although the steps in Chapters 2 through 10 can be carried out sequen- tially, note that, in practice, aspects such as data sources, data representation, and data quality are often carried out in parallel and reiteratively. This also applies to the variable/factor selection, analysis, and modeling steps. However, note that the better each step is performed, the fewer iterations will be necessary. In order to obtain meaningful results, data analysis requires an attention to detail, an adequate project definition, meticulous preparation of the data, in- vestigative capacity, patience, rigor, and objectives that are well defined from the beginning. If these requirements are taken together as a starting point, then a basis can be built from which a data warehouse is converted into a high- value asset. One of the motivators for data analysis is to realize a return on investment for the database infrastructures that many businesses have installed. Another is to gain competitive leverage and insight for products and services by better understanding the marketplace, including customer and competitor behavior. 1 
Analitica  W YEL MAG CY AN BLACK L A S SE SKARBO VIK january 2006 99 DECISION MAKING E ALL KNOW THE POWER of the killer app. Over the years, groundbreaking systems from compa- nies such as American Airlines (electronic reservations), Otis Elevator (predictive maintenance), and American Hospital Supply (online ordering) have dramatically boosted their creators’ revenues and reputations. These heralded – and coveted – applications amassed and ap- plied data in ways that upended customer expectations and optimized operations to unprecedented degrees. They transformed technology from a supporting tool into a strategic weapon. Companies questing for killer apps generally focus all their firepower on the one area that promises to create the greatest competitive advantage. But a new breed of company is upping the stakes. Organizations such as Amazon, Harrah’s, Capital One, and the Boston Red Sox have dominated their fields by deploying industrial- strength analytics across a wide variety of activities. In essence, they are transforming their organizations into armies of killer apps and crunching their way to victory. Organizations are competing on analytics not just be- cause they can–business today is awash in data and data Every company can learn from what these firms do. by Thomas H. Davenport Some  companies have built their very businesses  on their ability  to collect, analyze, and  act on data. COMPETING ON ANALYTICS crunchers–but also because they should. At a time when firms in many industries offer similar products and use comparable technologies, business processes are among the last remaining points of differentiation. And analyt- ics competitors wring every last drop of value from those processes. So, like other companies, they know what prod- ucts their customers want, but they also know what prices those customers will pay, how many items each will buy in a lifetime, and what triggers will make people buy more. Like other companies, they know compensation costs and turnover rates, but they can also calculate how much per- sonnel contribute to or detract from the bottom line and how salary levels relate to individuals’ performance. Like other companies, they know when inventories are run- ning low, but they can also predict problems with demand and supply chains, to achieve low rates of inventory and high rates of perfect orders. And analytics competitors do all those things in a coor- dinated way, as part of an overarching strategy champi- oned by top leadership and pushed down to decision mak- ers at every level. Employees hired for their expertise with numbers or trained to recognize their importance are armed with the best evidence and the best quantitative tools. As a result, they make the best decisions: big and small, every day, over and over and over. Although numerous organizations are embracing ana- lytics, only a handful have achieved this level of profi- ciency. But analytics competitors are the leaders in their varied fields–consumer products, finance, retail, and travel and entertainment among them. Analytics has been in- strumental to Capital One, which has exceeded 20% growth in earnings per share every year since it became  a public company. It has allowed Amazon to dominate on- line retailing and turn a profit despite enormous invest- ments in growth and infrastructure. In sports, the real se- cret weapon isn’t steroids, but stats, as dramatic victories by the Boston Red Sox, the New England Patriots, and the Oakland A’s attest. At such organizations, virtuosity with data is often part of the brand. Progressive makes advertising hay from its detailed parsing of individual insurance rates. Amazon customers can watch the company learning about them as its service grows more targeted with frequent pur- chases. Thanks to Michael Lewis’s best-selling book Mon- eyball, which demonstrated the power of statistics in pro- fessional baseball, the Oakland A’s are almost as famous for their geeky number crunching as they are for their athletic prowess. To identify characteristics shared by analytics compet- itors, I and two of my colleagues at Babson College’s Working Knowledge Research Center studied 32 organi- zations that have made a commitment to quantitative, fact-based analysis. Eleven of those organizations we clas- sified as full-bore analytics competitors, meaning top management had announced that analytics was key to their strategies; they had multiple initiatives under way involving complex data and statistical analysis, and they managed analytical activity at the enterprise (not depart- mental) level. This article lays out the characteristics and practices of these statistical masters and describes some of the very substantial changes other companies must undergo in order to compete on quantitative turf. As one would ex- pect, the transformation requires a significant invest- ment in technology, the accumulation of massive stores of data, and the formulation of companywide strategies for managing the data. But at least as important, it re- quires executives’ vocal, unswerving commitment and willingness to change the way employees think, work, and are treated. As Gary Loveman, CEO of analytics competi- tor Harrah’s, frequently puts it,“Do we think this is true? Or do we know?” Anatomy of an Analytics Competitor O ne analytics competitor that’s at the top of its game is Marriott International. Over the past 20 years, the corporation has honed to a science its system for establishing the optimal price for guest rooms (the key analytics process in hotels, known as rev- enue management). Today, its ambitions are far grander. Through its Total Hotel Optimization program, Marriott has expanded its quantitative expertise to areas such as conference facilities and catering, and made related tools available over the Internet to property revenue managers and hotel owners. It has developed systems to optimize of- ferings to frequent customers and assess the likelihood of those customers’ defecting to competitors. It has given local revenue managers the power to override the sys- tem’s recommendations when certain local factors can’t be predicted (like the large number of Hurricane  Katrina evacuees arriving in Houston). The company has even created a revenue opportunity model, which com- putes actual revenues as a percentage of the optimal rates that could have been charged. That figure has grown from 83% to 91% as Marriott’s revenue-management analytics has taken root throughout the enterprise. The word is out among property owners and franchisees: If you want to squeeze the most revenue from your inventory, Marriott’s approach is the ticket. Clearly, organizations such as Marriott don’t behave like traditional companies. Customers notice the differ- ence in every interaction; employees and vendors live the 100 harvard business review DECISION MAKING Thomas H.

He is the author of Thinking for a Living (Harvard Business School Press, 2005). difference every day. Our study found three key attributes among analytics competitors:  Widespread use of modeling and optimization. Any company can generate simple descriptive statistics about aspects of its business–average revenue per employee, for example, or average order size. But analytics competitors look well beyond basic statistics. These companies use predictive modeling to identify the most profitable cus- tomers – plus those with the greatest profit potential and the ones most likely to cancel their accounts. They pool data generated in-house and data ac- quired from outside sources (which they analyze more deeply than do their less statistically savvy competitors) for a comprehensive understanding of their customers. They optimize their supply chains and can thus determine the impact of an unexpected con- straint, simulate alternatives, and route shipments around problems. They es- tablish prices in real time to get the highest yield possible from each of their customer transactions. They cre- ate complex models of how their oper- ational costs relate to their financial performance. Leaders in analytics also use sophis- ticated experiments to measure the overall impact or “lift” of intervention strategies and then apply the results  to continuously improve subsequent analyses. Capital One, for example, con- ducts more than 30,000 experiments  a year, with different interest rates, incentives, direct-mail packaging, and other variables. Its goal is to maximize the likelihood both that potential cus- tomers will sign up for credit cards and that they will pay back Capital One. Progressive employs similar experi- ments using widely available insurance industry data. The company defines narrow groups, or cells, of customers: for example, motorcycle riders ages 30 and above, with college educations, credit scores over a certain level, and no accidents. For each cell, the com- pany performs a regression analysis to identify factors that most closely corre- late with the losses that group engen- ders. It then sets prices for the cells, which should enable the company to earn a profit across a portfolio of cus- tomer groups, and uses simulation soft- ware to test the financial implications of those hypotheses. With this approach, Progressive can profitably insure customers in traditionally high-risk cat- egories. Other insurers reject high-risk customers out of hand, without bothering to delve more deeply into the data (although even traditional competitors, such as All- state, are starting to embrace analytics as a strategy). An enterprise approach. Analytics competitors under- stand that most business functions–even those, like mar- keting, that have historically depended on art rather than science–can be improved with sophisticated quantitative january 2006 101 YEL MAG CY AN BLACK Competing on Analytics techniques. These organizations don’t gain advantage from one killer app, but rather from multiple applications supporting many parts of the business – and, in a few cases, being rolled out for use by customers and suppliers. UPS embodies the evolution from targeted analytics user to comprehensive analytics competitor. Although the company is among the world’s most rigorous practi- tioners of operations research and industrial engineering, its capabilities were, until fairly recently, narrowly fo- cused. Today, UPS is wielding its statistical skill to track the movement of packages and to anticipate and influ- ence the actions of people – assessing the likelihood of customer attrition and identifying sources of problems. The UPS Customer Intelligence Group, for example, is able to accurately predict customer defections by examin- ing usage patterns and complaints. When the data point to a potential defector, a salesperson contacts that cus- tomer to review and resolve the problem, dramatically re- ducing the loss of accounts. UPS still lacks the breadth of initiatives of a full-bore analytics competitor, but it is heading in that direction. Analytics competitors treat all such activities from all provenances as a single, coherent initiative, often massed under one rubric, such as “information-based strategy” at Capital One or “information-based customer manage- ment” at Barclays Bank. These programs operate not just under a common label but also under common leader- ship and with common technology and tools. In tradi- tional companies, “business intelligence” (the term IT people use for analytics and reporting processes and soft- ware) is generally managed by departments; number- crunching functions select their own tools, control their own data warehouses, and train their own people. But that way, chaos lies. For one thing, the proliferation of user-developed spreadsheets and databases inevitably leads to multiple versions of key indicators within an or- ganization. Furthermore, research has shown that be- tween 20% and 40% of spreadsheets contain errors; the more spreadsheets floating around a company, therefore, the more fecund the breeding ground for mistakes. Ana- lytics competitors, by contrast, field centralized groups to ensure that critical data and other resources are well man- aged and that different parts of the organization can share data easily, without the impediments of inconsis- tent formats, definitions, and standards. Some analytics competitors apply the same enterprise approach to people as to technology. Procter & Gamble, for example, recently created a kind of überanalytics group consisting of more than 100 analysts from such functions as operations, supply chain, sales, consumer re- search, and marketing. Although most of the analysts are embedded in business operating units, the group is cen- 102 harvard business review DECISION MAKING The analysis-versus-instinct debate, a favorite of political commentators during the last two U.S. presidential elec- tions, is raging in professional sports, thanks to several popular books and high-profile victories. For now, analysis seems to hold the lead. Most notably, statistics are a major part of the selec- tion and deployment of players. Moneyball, by Michael Lewis, focuses on the use of analytics in player selection for the Oakland A’s – a team that wins on a shoestring. The New England Patriots, a team that devotes an enormous amount of attention to statistics, won three of the last four Super Bowls, and their payroll is currently ranked 24th in  the league. The Boston Red Sox have embraced “sabermet- rics” (the application of analysis to baseball), even going  so far as to hire Bill James, the famous baseball statistician who popularized that term. Analytic HR strategies are tak- ing hold in European soccer as well. One leading team, Italy’s A.C. Milan, uses predictive models from its Milan Lab research center to prevent injuries by analyzing physi- ological, orthopedic, and psychological data from a variety of sources. A fast-rising English soccer team, the Bolton Wanderers, is known for its manager’s use of extensive data to evaluate players’ performance. Still, sports managers – like business leaders – are rarely fact-or-feeling purists. St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, for example, brilliantly combines analytics with in- tuition to decide when to substitute a charged-up player  in the batting lineup or whether to hire a spark-plug per- sonality to improve morale. In his recent book, Three Nights in August, Buzz Bissinger describes that balance: “La Russa appreciated the information generated by com- puters. He studied the rows and the columns. But he also knew they could take you only so far in baseball, maybe even confuse you with a fog of overanalysis. As far as he knew, there was no way to quantify desire. And those num- bers told him exactly what he needed to know when added to twenty-four years of managing experience.” That final sentence is the key. Whether scrutinizing someone’s performance record or observing the expres- sion flitting across an employee’s face, leaders consult  their own experience to understand the “evidence” in all  its forms.

Analitica Investment Highlights: • After attending conferences sponsored by the Data Warehouse Institute and HNC Software last week, we remain confident our e-Business Analytics investment thesis remains on track.  We had the opportunity to speak with customers and companies about technologies present and future. What we saw and heard confirms our belief that the role of analytics is in transition from reactive (analyzing what has already occurred) to proactive (driving business decisions).   We believe business analytics are evolving toward real-time predictive technologies that help businesses manage risk and capitalize on opportunity. • Business Intelligence continues to proliferate across the enterprise, but businesses show more signs of gravitating away from standalone tools toward higher value added solutions such as B2B extranets and Analytical Applications.  With the BI market feeling the effects of the current slowdown, we believe Business Objects (BOBJ – Buy) and Informatica (INFA – Accumulate) remain best positioned to benefit from this trend. We remain cautious on Cognos (COGN – Neutral) and Brio (BRIO – Neutral). • Growing interest in CRM data warehousing has breathed new life into a formerly somnolent discipline.  Consequently, data warehousing is increasingly strategic to large companies, but project managers struggle with inconsistent data quality and management’s inability to articulate goals and objectives. • Businesses demand larger data warehouses that incorporate more heterogeneous data sources, and expect results of value faster than ever. We continue to see strong demand for solutions that ease the pain of the data integration, particularly those offered by INFA. • We think clickstream analysis remains outside the corporate mainstream. We believe large organizations regard clickstream capabilities as a distinct feature of their overall analytic requirements, albeit one that represents an obstinate integration challenge. • We saw a lot of emphasis on advances in graphically rendering data. We believe visualization technologies become increasingly relevant as the volume of both structured and unstructured data grows and interrelationships become more sophisticated.  We also expect geographic enhancement will become a common feature of BI solutions.

We attended conferences sponsored by both the Data Warehouse Institute and HNC Software (HNCS – No Opinion), and had the opportunity to speak with users, customers and vendors at length. We believe businesses are showing signs of gravitating away from standalone tools toward higher value added solutions such as B2B extranets and Analytical Applications.  With the BI tools market feeling the effects of the current slowdown, we believe companies such as Business Objects (BOBJ – Buy; $55.31) and Informatica (INFA – Accumulate; $22.38) remain best positioned to benefit from this trend. Data Warehousing — Traditional Challenges in a New Context At the Data Warehouse Institute Conference, users came to pick up practical skills and techniques for their current practices.  Our takeaway from the conference was that while data warehousing takes on new roles and increasing strategic importance in the enterprise, fundamental practices and challenges remain the same.  This relatively mature discipline gains greater currency as businesses begin generating massive amounts of data from ERP, CRM, SCM and e-commerce systems.  While data warehousing is widespread among the large companies we spoke with, the reality of a unified warehouse – one that integrates all the organization’s strategic data sources - remains the province of a vanguard minority.  The companies we spoke with, who represent mainstream bricks and mortar industries, still struggle with basic implementation issues. Fundamental concerns remain data quality and organizational issues.  Cleaning up data so that it can be used for analysis remains a significant pain point – one that comes down to fundamental design of transactional systems.  Private companies like Vality, FirstLogic and Evoke attempt to ease the pain associated with cleaning data, but the process invariably requires lots of “elbow grease” from warehouse administrators.  Aligning management expectations with the objectives of the data warehouse remains a perpetual organizational challenge. What is changing is how strategic companies regard their data warehousing initiatives.  Data warehousing projects historically have subscribed to the 2/2/50 rule (projects take 2 years, cost 2 million, and have a 50% chance of success).  We kept hearing of growing pressure on data warehouse project managers to deliver value more quickly. Data warehouses are scaling ever larger, must handle increasingly diverse sources of data, and the delivery of value (in the form of actionable Business Intelligence) is demanded more quickly. As large ERP and CRM implementation continue to come on line, scale becomes an issue as businesses look to leverage the proliferation of new operational and transactional data.  We heard of one company with 100 Terabytes of information in its existing warehouse, and had just implemented e-commerce applications expected to add an additional 7 terabytes per week.  Increasing demand for storage is directly linked to the ballooning size of warehouse projects.  The trend toward larger warehouses is not just a function of an increase in transactional data. The accuracy of predictive models improves the larger the data set, and companies are taking this to heart. Data integration challenges accompany the trend toward the enterprise-wide data warehouse.  Data marts remain popular for domain-specific uses (such as HR), we are hearing of more companies forsaking a silo approach in favor of an enterprise data warehouse.  Clickstream data represents an obstinate challenge for the majority of companies we spoke with, and we heard of surprisingly few firms actually integrating clickstream data into a warehouse. To ease the pain involved with integrating and refreshing data from disparate sources, companies are increasingly relying on packaged ETL solutions, typically from Informatica.  From what we heard and saw, interest in Informatica’s products remains robust, continuing the trend demonstrated by the company’s strong results in the December quarter. We also heard of growing demand to deliver results more quickly.  Companies we spoke to prefer to purchase packaged solutions rather than tools, but the market for of packaged analytical applications is still in its early stages. Analytics Undergoing a Transformation from Tools… Business Intelligence is clearly in the mainstream, and our conversations confirm the proliferation of BI beyond IT to regular business users.  OLAP, ad hoc query and reporting are deployed across the enterprise as standard management tools.  As a result, users increasingly view BI tools as a commodity. What we heard confirms our “reactive to proactive” analytics thesis- that we believe the market for analytics is moving away from standalone BI tools toward higher value added solutions such as B2B extranets and Analytical Applications. We heard users repeatedly cite demand for sophisticated analytical models with better predictive capabilities. The views we heard jibe with our belief that the BI market is experiencing a slowdown as evinced by December 2000 results and Cognos’(COGN- Neutral; $17.81) pre- announced 4QFY01 (February) miss. Companies with a sole focus on BI tools either missed December expectations, as in the case of Cognos, MicroStrategy (MSTR- Accumulate; $9.12), and SPSS (SPSS- No Opinion), or met or beat reduced expectations, as in Brio’s (BRIO – Neutral; $7.44) case. Companies with a focus on higher value solutions such as e-commerce extranets, in Business Objects and Actuate’s (ACTU- No Opinion) case, and Analytical Applications, in the case of Informatica, posted stellar results that outperformed all metrics.  From what we saw and heard at the conference, interest in BI tools remains healthy, but interest is shifting toward the higher value e-Business Analytics – 6 March 2001 3 solutions.  While users clearly perceive the distinct technological strengths among the BI vendors, we believe this is a war to be won on execution. …To Packaged Applications We believe the biggest value in Analytical Applications lies in the use of statistics to solve business problems. Building successful predictive models from scratch is a lengthy iterative process, costly to effect in house. The value of solutions that incorporate prepackaged data marts and analytics continues to resonate with buyers. While we hear purists scoff at the relative technological merits of packaged solutions such as those from Broadbase (BBSW- Accumulate; $3.19) and E.piphany (EPNY – Accumulate; $14.00), we believe they remain a cost-effective alternative to developing similar homegrown solutions. The importance of predictive models is most clearly established in the area of risk management.  At HNC’s technology conference, we spoke with a number of customers that benefit from managing risk with predictive models.  We spoke to a telco who uses predictive software to identify potential “no-pay” customers, guard against customer churn and increase the long-term value of customers with retention strategies.  Predictive models are perhaps best developed for managing credit risk and fraud. We spoke with one credit card company which processes millions of transactions yearly that has saves untold millions of dollars a year employing fraud detection software. We heard how risk management and fraud detection models benefit from access to large data sets. HNC convinced a consortium of financial companies to pool their transactional data to aid in developing its predictive solutions for managing risk and preventing fraud. With predictive technology successfully established, the focus turns toward driving top-line growth. However, businesses must rely on smaller sets of proprietary, vertical sales data when developing revenue enhancing predictive models, so early generations are less effective. Naturally, we expect marketing analytical models to improve with time as they are refined with more data. The CRM-Centric Data Warehouse A recurring theme is the increasing corporate focus on building a CRM-centric data warehouse. We hear repeatedly that companies want to leverage data generated by recently deployed CRM systems, which in turn drives new data warehousing initiatives.  Growing interest in CRM data warehousing has breathed new life into a formerly somnolent discipline.  We believe this is an early indication of the coming analytic software wave, which we expect will accelerate as businesses look to integrate data from existing ERP as well as Supply Chain and e- Commerce applications.  Companies we spoke with envision a unified analytical framework to leverage this data, but integration and modeling obstacles need to be addressed first. Clickstream Not Yet Mainstream We attended a discussion on the use of clickstream data in the data warehouse.  As large corporations adopt the e- commerce business model, clickstream data grows in importance by providing insights into shopping cart abandonment and customer behavior profiling.  However, discussions with users suggest that challenges associated with managing clickstream data remain an obstacle to many companies’ desire to incorporate clickstream elements into an enterprise data warehouse. While pure dot.coms commonly regard specialized clickstream analytics as a must, users from large companies spoke of reluctance to tackle integrating clickstream data into an enterprise data warehouse. Customers we spoke with are not convinced that benefits currently outweigh the costs.  Their concerns center on data quality - clickstream requires significant effort to transform it into usable data – and usability- extracting insight is often difficult. Clickstream data requires an enormous amount of preprocessing – somewhere between 60-95% of the time is spent preparing data.  Web data presents unique problems. To prepare data for analysis, businesses need to identify users and sessions, complete navigation paths, clean data and integrate with other data. Obstacles accompany each aspect of the process. Once data has been prepared, analysis itself is another challenge. We heard one estimate that it takes 2 years for to learn the particularities of clickstream data adequately enough to write effective models. While we expect the strategic value will increase over time, we think clickstream analysis remains outside the corporate mainstream. With the exception of dot.com subsidiaries, we believe large organizations currently regard clickstream capabilities as a single feature of their overall analytic requirements. This was supported by the scanty levels of adoption we perceived among attendees at the Data Warehousing conference. We believe corporate regard for this technology on a standalone basis is apparent in the recent financial results of pure clickstream analytics vendors, particularly Accrue (ACRU- No Opinion). Nonetheless, we believe the pain associated with integrating clickstream could be a longer-term demand driver for Informatica’s data integration platform. A Look At Visualization “You can see a lot just by looking” – Yogi Berra We attended a number of discussions and presentations during the week focused on graphical representation of structured data as well as the ability to search and index unstructured images. The visual representation of information is an integral component of data analysis.  Visual depictions deliver greater bandwidth, especially for large data sets. Visualization capabilities provide a powerful means to uncover patterns, trends and anomalies from complex data sets. One speaker e-Business Analytics – 6 March 2001 4 referred to data visualization as Interocular Inference, the ability to spot patterns in the data that would be difficult if not impossible to identify otherwise. Business Intelligence and statistical tool vendors typically incorporate rudimentary graphs and charts into their offerings.  Simple graphics work best for business users. We continue to hear users speak of the value of streamlined executive dashboard systems that monitor Key Performance Indicators.  We expect demand for KPI dashboards to drive growth for BI vendors including Business Objects, Brio and Cognos as tools are employed to package vertical metrics into Analytical Applications. Simple graphics have not kept pace with a need to manage increasingly complex data sets.  There are a number of BI start-ups with an emphasis on visualization including private companies Visual Insights and HighTower software.  We were impressed with a demo of the privately held SAS Institute’s new WebHound interface, which offers a stem-oriented visual navigation of the contents of a data warehouse. One of the leading companies with advanced visualization technology remains privately held Spotfire, whose capabilities enable users to intuitively perform relevant analysis on the massive data sets found in the pharmaceutical, chemical, life sciences, high technology and other R&D intensive businesses.  Spotfire announced a large deal last week with AstraZeneca, which furthers the company’s penetration of the pharmaceuticals industry.  We anticipate robust growth in demand for solutions enabling visualization of larger and more sophisticated data sets. We are also seeing increasing use of visualization for categorizing unstructured data.  Private companies creating cartographic representations of topic relationships include Cartia (acquired by Aurigen) and Map.net. Earlier in the week we saw a demonstration of privately held Inxight Software’s unique hyperbolic tree interface, which enables users to visually navigate a document repository by context. We believe visualization becomes increasingly relevant as the volume of both structured and unstructured data grows and interrelationships become more sophisticated. We also saw a demo of new visual search technology currently being developed by HNC.  Their content-based search provides the ability to classify images according to general features (color, textures and shapes) as well as domain-specific features (faces, fingerprints and signatures).  The company is developing technology that can be used not only to aid law enforcement and transaction verification, but also to provide the ability to match similar images across a repository.  Potential uses include improving the experience of online art sales (“Show me something similar to”) as well as helping media companies catalogue their image assets.  While this technology is still in development, we believe the integration with unstructured data search capabilities has promise for highly specialized uses. Geo-Spatial Data Use Growing We also heard and saw presentations on incorporating geo- spatial data into the analytical process.  Geo-spatial enhancements offer businesses greater granularity of insight into specific aspects of their data.  However, there are unique considerations such as multiple ways of referencing the same location and incompatible referencing systems. We heard a case study concerning Maine’s Department of Transportation, which geo-enhanced its data warehouse to perform traffic safety analysis and road infrastructure management.  Current uses of geo-spatial data include demographic profiling for marketing personalization as well as logistical optimization for transportation and field service. Current vendors such as privately held ESRI, Inc. and MapInfo (MAPS – No Opinion) provide spatial data, while Sagent’s (SGNT – No Opinion) QMSoft technology ties demographic profiling sources to customer location.  We saw a small private BI startup Systrack display customer locations color-coded by performance threshold.  We expect geographic rendering will become a common feature enhancement to leading BI solutions. The Unstructured Data Frontier We attended a discussion on integrating unstructured data into the data warehouse.  With 80% of a typical organization’s data consisting of unstructured data, we believe businesses will ultimately demand solutions offering unified access to all the enterprise’s data stores. Businesses currently address this either by storing unstructured data directly in the warehouse, which requires specialized modifications to query language, or by adopting a portal-type interface, which allows users to access multiple sources of data from a single point.  A professor we spoke with envisions “mediator” technology. This would parse a complex query (“show me the phone numbers of our top 10 most profitable customers for the last 6 months”), access the correct sources, collect and present the proper information. This technology is still in the conceptual stages, but we expect to see more developments that seek to unite the realms of structured and unstructured analytics.  Currently this is more an area of intellectual curiosity than corporate pain point, but we find research in this area promising.

Dedication To the contributors to the Open Source Software movement We dedicate this book to all those talented and generous developers around  the world who continue to add enormous value to open source software tools,  without whom this book would have never seen light of day. xi Foreword Everybody can be a data scientist. And everybody should be. This book shows  you why everyone should be a data scientist and how you can get there. In  today’s world, it should be embarrassing to make any complex decision with- out understanding the available data first. Being a “data-driven organization”  is the state of the art and often the best way to improve a business outcome  significantly. Consequently we have seen a dramatic change with respect to the  tools supporting us to get to this success quickly. It has only been a few years  that building a data warehouse and creating reports or dashboards on top of  the data warehouse has become the norm in larger organizations. Technologi- cal advances have made this process easier than ever and in fact, the existence  of data discovery tools have allowed business users to build dashboards them- selves without the need for an army of Information Technology consultants  supporting them in this endeavor. But now, after we have managed to effec- tively answer questions based on our data from the past, a new paradigm shift  is underway: Wouldn’t it be better to answer what is going to happen instead?  This is the realm of advanced analytics and data science: moving your interest  from the past to the future and optimizing the outcomes of your business  proactively. Here are some examples of this paradigm shift:  ?   Traditional Business Intelligence (BI) system and program answers: How  many customers did we lose last year? Although certainly interesting, the  answer comes too late: the customers are already gone and there is not  much we can do about it. Predictive analytics will show you who will  most likely churn within the next 10 days and what you can do best for each  customer to keep them.  ?   Traditional BI answers: What campaign was the most successful in the past?  Although certainly interesting, the answer will only provide limited  value to determine what is the best campaign for your upcoming  product. Predictive analytics will show you what will be the next best  action to trigger a purchase action for each of your prospects individually. xii Foreword  ?   Traditional BI answers: How often did my production stand still in the past  and why? Although certainly interesting, the answer will not change the  fact that profit was decreased due to suboptimal utilization. Predictive  analytics will show you exactly when and why a part of a machine will  break and when you should replace the parts instead of backlogging production  without control. Those are all high-value questions and knowing the answers has the potential  to positively impact your business processes like nothing else. And the good  news is that this is not science fiction; predicting the future based on data  from the past and the inherent patterns living in the data is absolutely possible  today. So why isn’t every company in the world exploiting this potential all day  long? The answer is the data science skills gap. Performing advanced analytics (predictive analytics, data mining, text ana- lytics, and the necessary data preparation) requires, well, advanced skills. In  fact, a data scientist is seen as a superstar programmer with a PhD in statis- tics who just happens to understand every business problem in the world. Of  course people with such a rare skill mix are very rare; in fact McKinsey has  predicted a shortage of 1.8 million data scientists by the year 2018 only in  the United States. This is a classical dilemma: we have identified the value of   future-oriented questions and solving them with data science methods, but at  the same time we can’t find the answers to those questions since we don’t have  the people able to do so. The only way out of this dilemma is a democratization of  advanced analytics. We need to empower more people to do create predictive  models: business analysts, Excel power users, data-savvy business managers.  We can’t transform this group of people magically into data scientists, but we  can give them the tools and show them how to use them to act like a data   scientist. This book can guide you in this direction. We are in a time of modern analytics with “big data” fueling the explosion  for the need of answers. It is important to understand that big data is not just  about volume but also about complexity. More data means new and more  complex infrastructures. Unstructured data requires new ways of storage and  retrieval. And sometimes the data is generated so fast it should not be stored  at all, but analyzed directly at the source and the findings stored instead. Real- time analytics, stream mining, and the Internet of Things become a reality now.  At the same time, it is also clear that we are in the midst of a sea change: data  alone has no value, but the hidden patterns and insights in the data are an  extremely valuable asset. Accessing this asset should no longer be an option  for experts only but should be given into the hands of analytical practitioners  and business managers of all kinds. This democratization of advanced analyt- ics removes the bottleneck of data science and unleashes new business value  in an instant.

Analitica Embedded Analytics in IBM DB2  Universal Database for Information  on Demand Information Integration Software Solutions White paper August 2003 Embedded Analytics in IBM DB2 Universal Database for Information on Demand Page 2 Embedded Analytics in IBM DB2 Universal Database for Information on Demand Page 3 Finding the needle of competitive advantage in a haystack of data One of the major business insights of our time is that information can be more  valuable than capital assets in helping your firm stay competitive and profitable.  Today’s technology can deliver more bits of information about your company or  competitors than existed in all the world’s books 500 years ago. Yet paradoxically,  the more information is at your fingertips, the harder it may be to derive  useful answers from it, at least in the time frame that our fast-paced  environment demands. For example, you may wonder which of your shopper populations is the most  profitable—and what promotional offer would be the most effective in getting  that group to buy more. Or, which of your stores is running short of lawn chairs  and barbecues soonest—and can any of your suppliers ship fresh inventory  before summer ends? You suspect that the answers are hidden somewhere in the  thousands, or even millions, of rows of transactional and purchasing data your  company generates every month.  But the conventional wisdom is that only data-mining specialists have the  skills and the tools to dig the answers out, by extracting data from the database  serving your enterprise applications, loading it into a data warehouse and  spending days or weeks combing through it. When this process is repeated, the  data sets extracted at different times can develop incompatibilities that deliver  conflicting answers, leading to corporate chaos. Moreover, the specialists’ skills  are costly. When the data mining process becomes too unwieldy or expensive,  companies often decide to skip it, leaving important insights undiscovered. Data mining doesn’t have to be an expensive, time-consuming process that  only specialists can carry out. IBM has taken the high-powered data mining  functions that used to require specialized, stand-alone analytic tools, and  embedded those functions directly in the data warehouse, putting the power  of real-time analysis at users’ fingertips in a cost-effective way. With DB2 ®   information management software from IBM, the power of data mining can be  Contents 2 Finding the needle of   competitive advantage in a   haystack of data 3 Why efficient data mining   matters 4 IBM embeds analytic power   into the enterprise data   warehouse 5 Benefits for every corporate   department and level 6 From data to information   and knowledge 8 Data mining delivers value   every step of the way 10 Model, score and visualize:   Three steps to basic   data mining 14 Data mining should bring its   insights back home 15 Closing the business   intelligence loop with IBM’s   data mining tools 16 Keeping data where it belongs   —in the database 17 Opt for standard or custom   analysis 18 SQL and PMML promote easy   integration 19 Partner cooperation pays off   for data mining users Embedded Analytics in IBM DB2 Universal Database for Information on Demand Page 2 Embedded Analytics in IBM DB2 Universal Database for Information on Demand Page 3 infused into enterprise applications and used easily and intuitively, without any  statistical skills. And because the data stays in the applications that generated  it, everyone is working off the same set of answers and can therefore coordinate  their efforts more smoothly. This paper gives an overview of data mining, including what it is, how it  works and the difference between “data,” “information,” “knowledge” and  “business intelligence.” It then discusses how IBM’s data mining approach can offer your business  keener analytical insights that can help strengthen competitive advantage  and, ultimately, your profits. Why efficient data mining matters Data analysis has been around for more than 60 years. The cliché image involved  white-coated scientists feeding punch cards into a wall-sized supercomputer  covered with buttons and twinkling lights, then waiting hours or days for an  answer. Now, in the “Information Economy,” everybody wants that kind of  analytical insight, but cheaply and quickly. They know that successfully selling  goods or services depends on personalization and timing—that is, figuring out  the right messages to deliver to the right people at the most opportune time, and  coming up with the right answer while the customer is still within range. Several trends have combined to increase the demand for data mining. For  one thing, businesses are recognizing the success that stems from having a  single, company-wide mission, such as having diners wait no longer than three  minutes for a fresh hamburger, or achieving 100 percent customer satisfaction  in processing home loans. But this requires all departments of the company— including sales, manufacturing, procurement, marketing and bookkeeping—to  contribute towards this goal. Therefore, corporate leaders need data from all  these departments—and not just in raw form, but collected and reconciled into  a single view of the truth that everyone can work from. 20 Data mining can deliver value   to any industry 22 Data mining: Key to helping   your business turn on a dime 23 Server-based data mining   offers functionality, safety   and speed Contents Embedded Analytics in IBM DB2 Universal Database for Information on Demand Page 4 Embedded Analytics in IBM DB2 Universal Database for Information on Demand Page 5 Businesses are also finding that they must make decisions fast if they want to stay  competitive in fulfilling their customers’ demands—especially since e-commerce  has created rising expectations for instant demand fulfillment online. Information  on demand is a key prerequisite, now that time is as important a strategic weapon  as capital, productivity, quality or even innovation. A business that operates in an  “on demand” basis is integrated end-to-end; it can sense and respond to changes  (anything from an e-mail virus to a tornado to new fashion fads) in real time  because it’s resilient, responsive to varying demands and focused on its core  mission. But it can’t deliver this kind of fast response without accurate answers  delivered quickly. Technological progress has also supported the rise of data mining. On the  hardware and networking fronts, it continually delivers faster, higher-volume  delivery and more convenient, less expensive storage of large quantities of data.  On the software front, many vendors offer suites of connected applications  to automate manufacturing, supply-chain planning, financials, HR, sales and  customer service. Yet this technology can also be a handicap when it delivers  large quantities of uncorrelated facts that deliver limited insight of their own  accord. And many existing data mining products require data to be moved away  from the enterprise applications that generated them and into a separate data  warehouse tended by experts. IBM embeds analytic power into the enterprise data warehouse What companies need is a data mining solution with broad access, one that  leverages the power of the enterprise’s relational database instead of creating  stand-alone data “silos,” and can deliver information on demand to line-of- business (LOB) employees who aren’t necessarily analytical specialists.  IBM, a leader in information management for decades, has recently infused  data mining functionality directly into its flagship DB2 family of information  management software to deliver an unsurpassed combination of functionality,  Embedded Analytics in IBM DB2 Universal Database for Information on Demand Page 4 Embedded Analytics in IBM DB2 Universal Database for Information on Demand Page 5 speed and ease of use. In particular, IBM DB2 Universal Database™ Data  Warehouse Edition has been created to offer a complete data mart infrastructure  product that includes integrated online analytical processing (OLAP) and other  business intelligence functions. It includes at no extra charge key data mining  functions including modeling, scoring and visualization. (These capabilities  also continue to be sold separately, as does the stand-alone tool, DB2 Intelligent  Miner™ for Data.) This paper’s discussion of the latest developments in  data mining from IBM is based on the functions that are part of DB2 Data  Warehouse Edition. Benefits for every corporate department and level Just about every department can benefit from data mining. The most obvious  candidates are the marketing and sales departments, for outbound customer  contacts, and customer service, for inbound contacts. But a purchasing manager  can also use data mining technology embedded in the database of an ERP  application to find the most cost-effective suppliers, ranking them by price,  quality, delivery time and other factors. The head of factory-floor production  can sift through quality reports from data mining-enabled applications to figure  out which stages of the assembly line need to be retooled. Human resources  can quickly spot who’s using too much sick leave or not enough vacation time.  There’s a suitable flavor of data mining for every level of the organizational  pyramid, too. An LOB professional or a department head in a small organization  can get quick answers to focused questions, such as predicting which customers  are most likely to have problems paying their bills, so those accounts can be  watched more closely. A vice president can get a much more inclusive view of  the company’s overall account payment patterns this month.

Intelligent Business Strategies  Insurance Business Intelligence – A Model-Driven Approach To Integrated Analytics  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  A BI system is key to  business success  and requires high  availability,  scalability and  manageability   Executives and managers are becoming increasingly reliant on business intelligence  (BI) applications to provide them with the information they need to drive day-to-day  business operations in all business areas. Many companies, in fact, can no longer  operate effectively without this information, and a business intelligence system and  its underlying data warehouse now need to be comparable to operational systems in  their availability, scalability and manageability.   Customer  intelligence in  demand in marketing,  sales and service  This is particularly true in the front office, where business intelligence is needed to  better understand the customer and improve the effectiveness of marketing, sales and  customer service in all channels. Making intelligence available to all front office staff  and applications is paramount to consistent customer treatment and improving  customer relationships. Integrating it into campaign management, for example,  results in targeted multi-channel marketing campaigns. Integrating customer  intelligence into customer facing operational business processes makes a company a  customer-intelligent business in day-to-day operations.   Rapid deployment of  integrated BI needed  in all business areas   Increased demand for BI means pressure is mounting for faster deployment of  business intelligence in nearly all business areas, including marketing, sales,  customer service, corporate finance, human resource, procurement and supply chain  business functions. As a result, companies are considering packaged analytic  applications to speed up implementation and delivery of intelligence.  Companies now  buying packaged  analytic applications Many packaged intelligence solutions, however, are stand-alone systems that, when  implemented, are not integrated with existing business intelligence systems. They  also offer little in the way of deep vertical industry analytics and often only address  BI in a specific business area. What is really required is a means of rapidly extending  BI investment with preference to extensible packaged solutions that offer a deep  vertical industry understanding and that can be customized and integrated with  existing systems. In addition, companies are looking to simplify implementation by  rolling out all intelligence on common platforms to cut total cost of ownership.  Many packaged  analytic applications  only cover specific  business areas and  lack deep vertical  industry knowledge  The key to success, therefore, is the ability to establish an integrated set of vertical  industry enterprise analytics that can be rapidly deployed and extended on top of an  integrated data warehouse infrastructure. Such solutions need to easily integrate with  existing BI investments, and integrate into front office, corporate and back office  operational applications to leverage the intelligence in every day business operations.  In addition, these solutions need to integrate with, or offer, scorecard components to  facilitate strategic business performance monitoring.   Companies want  vertical industry  enterprise analytics  on common  platforms to minimise  cost of ownership   Such packaged business intelligence solutions offer rapid deployment, lower cost of  ownership and pre-built integration points into operational systems. At the same time,  these solutions can be customized and extended as budgetary constraints allow.    Intelligent Business Strategies  1  Insurance Business Intelligence – A Model-Driven Approach To Integrated Analytics  INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE ANALYTICS – THE NEXT  GENERATION IN BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS  Business intelligence  is crucial to running  a business effectively   Technologies and products for deploying business intelligence (BI) applications to  users have improved dramatically over the past few years. In the past, business  intelligence applications were perhaps nice to have but they now have become so  essential to strategic and tactical business decision making that organizations cannot  operate their businesses effectively without them. The demand to deliver business  intelligence to drive day-to-day operations has never been greater as companies seek  business intelligence in functions enterprise wide. However, despite the investment  that many companies have made in data warehousing and business intelligence, few  can claim that they can monitor performance in all business areas and provide full  customer intelligence to all front office operations in all channels to market. Even  fewer can claim that they have business intelligence that is integrated into daily  operational business processes for use by the mass user base. The demand for  actionable intelligence is still increasing as greater numbers of users require ‘just-in- time’ information to improve business performance. Thus the backlog of BI projects  in the pipeline for development is growing, which poses significant challenges for IT  staff. On the one hand, IT staff are increasingly required to spend time justifying BI  spending, while on the other, they face business pressure to speed up the delivery and  integration of intelligence to help achieve key business objectives.  This kind of pressure is driving businesses to consider customisable and extensible  packaged analytic application solutions to speed up BI application deployment.  However, buying packaged solutions, as an alternative to building them, is not  enough. Buying multiple packaged solutions that cover different aspects of business  performance can create stand-alone islands of intelligence on different platforms  using different business terminology. This approach can also increase complexity and  total cost of ownership and impact understanding in the user base. In addition,  because different sponsors often drive business intelligence projects, getting funding  for end-to-end enterprise analytics can be difficult.   Significant shift  toward the use of  packaged analytics  Hence many companies are looking to packaged alternatives and demanding  enterprise analytics solutions with a difference. They need solutions offering deep  analytics in their industry on top of a common BI platform. Solutions need to  integrate with what companies already have, be customisable to fit their business  terminology and be modular. Companies need to be able to expand their BI  investment by snapping together compatible models that offer a wider and deeper set  of integrated enterprisewide intelligence at a pace they dictate and that is in line with  their budgeting and planning.  Integrated  intelligence models  offer many benefits  for business  intelligence  processing  This paper discusses the issues involved in building an end-to-end business  intelligence system, looks at the benefits that packaged intelligence models have to  offer in such an environment, and reviews the insurance intelligence solutions  available from SAS Institute.    Intelligent Business Strategies  2  Insurance Business Intelligence – A Model-Driven Approach To Integrated Analytics  THE EVOLUTION OF BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND DATA WAREHOUSING  The business intelligence applications and data warehouses organizations use today  are a far cry from the mainframe-based batch reporting systems of the past, which  produced reams of paper that business users had to wade through to find the business  information they needed.   The amount of  information being  managed by data  warehouses is  growing rapidly  Data warehousing has enabled organizations to extract and integrate data from  diverse operational applications into warehouse databases containing clean and  consistent information stored in a form that business users can understand. Unlike  operational systems, which contain only detailed current data, a data warehouse also  provides historical information that enables business users to analyse and track trends  and patterns in business operations over time. As a data warehouse evolves and  matures, the amount of data it has to manage grows rapidly, and some organizations  now have data warehouses containing several terabytes of data.  Data warehousing by itself, however, will not fulfill all of business users’  information needs. Organizations have discovered that unless the information in their  data warehouse is thoroughly documented and easy to access, the data warehouse  will be too complex to use effectively. To help solve this problem, vendors  introduced business intelligence tools that focus on improving access to information  in a data warehouse, and on offering a rich set of information analysis capabilities.  Examples include online analytical processing (OLAP) and data mining technologies,  and the use of the Web as a cost-effective way to deliver business information to a  large user audience. To reduce development time and to improve ease of use, vendors  have also begun offering packaged enterprise analytic applications that exploit  existing business intelligence and data warehouse technologies. These application  packages are out-of-the-box solutions with analytics that can be customized to suit an  organization’s requirements.  Business intelligence  applications drive  day-to-day business  operations   Business intelligence applications and their associated data warehouses were viewed  until recently as strategic decision-making systems separate from the operational  applications that manage day-to-day business operations. There is now, however,  significant momentum in companies toward using the information and analyses that  BI systems provide for tactical day-to-day decision making as well — toward using  business intelligence to drive the business. The increasing exploitation of e-business  is also encouraging the use of business intelligence, since organizations need to react  much faster to changing business conditions in the e-business world than they do in  the traditional business environment, and business intelligence offers major benefits  here in optimising e-business operations.   Business intelligence  needs to be  integrated with  operational  processing  Using business intelligence to drive business operations requires business intelligence  processing and operations processing to become more integrated. This integration can  be achieved in a variety of ways. A common approach is to develop a closed-loop  decision-making system whereby the output of business intelligence applications (so- called actionable information) is routed to operational system users in the form of  recommended actions (product pricing changes, marketing campaign modifications,  identification of fraudulent transactions and so forth) to address specific business  issues. In the e-business environment, many companies are looking toward extending  this closed-loop process to the automatic adjustment of business operations and  marketing campaigns, based on decisions made by the business intelligence system.
